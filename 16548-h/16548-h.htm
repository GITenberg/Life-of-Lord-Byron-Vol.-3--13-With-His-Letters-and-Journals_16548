<p>"February 18.</p>

<p>"Better than a month since I last journalised:&mdash;most of it out of London
and at Notts., but a busy one and a pleasant, at least three weeks of
it. On my return, I find all the newspapers in hysterics<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page2" name="page2"></a>Pg 2</span>and town
in an uproar, on the avowal and republication of two stanzas on Princess
Charlotte's weeping at Regency's speech to Lauderdale in 1812. They are
daily at it still;&mdash;some of the abuse good, all of it hearty. They talk
of a motion in our House upon it&mdash;be it so.</p>

<p>"Got up&mdash;redde the Morning Post, containing the battle of Buonaparte,
the destruction of the Custom-house, and a paragraph on me as long as my
pedigree, and vituperative, as usual.</p>

<p>"Hobhouse is returned to England. He is my best friend, the most lively,
and a man of the most sterling talents extant.</p>

<p>"'The Corsair' has been conceived, written, published, &amp;c. since I last
took up this journal. They tell me it has great success;&mdash;it was written
<i>con amore</i>, and much from <i>existence</i>. Murray is satisfied with its
progress; and if the public are equally so with the perusal, there's an
end of the matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Nine o'clock.</p>

<p>"Been to Hanson's on business. Saw Rogers, and had a note from Lady
Melbourne, who says, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3" name="page3"></a>Pg 3</span> is said I am 'much out of spirits.' I wonder if
I really am or not? I have certainly enough of 'that perilous stuff
which weighs upon the heart,' and it is better they should believe it to
be the result of these attacks than of the real cause; but&mdash;ay, ay,
always <i>but</i>, to the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>"Hobhouse has told me ten thousand anecdotes of Napoleon, all good and
true. My friend H. is the most entertaining of companions, and a fine
fellow to boot.</p>

<p>"Redde a little&mdash;wrote notes and letters, and am alone, which Locke
says, is bad company. 'Be not solitary, be not idle.'&mdash;Um!&mdash;the idleness
is troublesome; but I can't see so much to regret in the solitude. The
more I see of men, the less I like them. If I could but say so of women
too, all would be well. Why can't I? I am now six-and-twenty; my
passions have had enough to cool them; my affections more than enough to
wither them,&mdash;and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;always <i>yet</i> and <i>but</i>&mdash;'Excellent well,
you are a fishmonger&mdash;get thee to a nunnery.'&mdash;'They fool me to the top
of my bent.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Midnight.</p>

<p>"Began a letter, which I threw into the fire. Redde&mdash;but to little
purpose. Did not visit Hobhouse, as I promised and ought. No matter, the
loss is mine. Smoked cigars.</p>

<p>"Napoleon!&mdash;this week will decide his fate. All seems against him; but I
believe and hope he will win&mdash;at least, beat back the invaders. What
right have we to prescribe sovereigns to France? Oh for<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>Pg 4</span> a Republic!
'Brutus, thou sleepest.' Hobhouse abounds in continental anecdotes of
this extraordinary man; all in favour of his intellect and courage, but
against his <i>bonhommie</i>. No wonder;&mdash;how should he, who knows mankind
well, do other than despise and abhor them?</p>

<p>"The greater the equality, the more impartially evil is distributed, and
becomes lighter by the division among so many&mdash;therefore, a Republic!</p>

<p>"More notes from Mad. de * * unanswered&mdash;and so they shall remain. I
admire her abilities, but really her society is overwhelming&mdash;an
avalanche that buries one in glittering nonsense&mdash;all snow and
sophistry.</p>

<p>"Shall I go to Mackintosh's on Tuesday? um!&mdash;I did not go to Marquis
Lansdowne's, nor to Miss Berry's, though both are pleasant. So is Sir
James's,&mdash;but I don't know&mdash;I believe one is not the better for parties;
at least, unless some <i>regnante</i> is there.</p>

<p>"I wonder how the deuce any body could make such a world; for what
purpose dandies, for instance, were ordained&mdash;and kings&mdash;and fellows of
colleges&mdash;and women of 'a certain age'&mdash;and many men of any age&mdash;and
myself, most of all!</p>

<p>"Is there any thing beyond?&mdash;<i>who</i> knows? <i>He</i> that can't tell. Who
tells that there <i>is</i>? He who<span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>Pg 5</span> don't know. And when shall he know?
perhaps, when he don't expect, and generally when he don't wish it. In
this last respect, however, all are not alike: it depends a good deal
upon education,&mdash;something upon nerves and habits&mdash;but most upon
digestion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Saturday, Feb. 19.</p>

<p>"Just returned from seeing Kean in Richard. By Jove, he is a soul!
Life&mdash;nature&mdash;truth without exaggeration or diminution. Kemble's Hamlet
is perfect;&mdash;but Hamlet is not Nature. Richard is a man; and Kean is
Richard. Now to my own concerns.</p>

<p>"Went to Waite's. Teeth all right and white; but he says that I grind
them in my sleep and chip the edges. That same sleep is no friend of
mine, though I court him sometimes for half the twenty-four.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"February 20.</p>

<p>"Got up and tore out two leaves of this Journal&mdash;I don't know why.
Hodgson just called and gone. He has much <i>bonhommie</i> with his other
good qualities, and more talent than he has yet had credit for beyond
his circle.</p>

<p>"An invitation to dine at Holland House to meet Kean. He is worth
meeting; and I hope, by getting into good society, he will be prevented
from falling like Cooke. He is greater now on the stage, and off he
should never be less. There is a stupid and under-rating criticism upon
him in one of the newspapers. I thought that, last night, though great,
he rather under-acted more than the first time. This may be the effect
of these cavils; but I hope he has<span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name="page6"></a>Pg 6</span> more sense than to mind them. He
cannot expect to maintain his present eminence, or to advance still
higher, without the envy of his green-room fellows, and the nibbling of
their admirers. But, if he don't beat them all, why then&mdash;merit hath no
purchase in 'these coster-monger days.'</p>

<p>"I wish that I had a talent for the drama; I would write a tragedy
<i>now</i>. But no,&mdash;it is gone. Hodgson talks of one,&mdash;he will do it
well;&mdash;and I think M&mdash;e should try. He has wonderful powers, and much
variety; besides, he has lived and felt. To write so as to bring home to
the heart, the heart must have been tried,&mdash;but, perhaps, ceased to be
so. While you are under the influence of passions, you only feel, but
cannot describe them,&mdash;any more than, when in action, you could turn
round and tell the story to your next neighbour! When all is over,&mdash;all,
all, and irrevocable,&mdash;trust to memory&mdash;she is then but too faithful.</p>

<p>"Went out, and answered some letters, yawned now and then, and redde the
Robbers. Fine,&mdash;but Fiesco is better; and Alfieri and Monti's Aristodemo
<i>best</i>. They are more equal than the Tedeschi dramatists.</p>

<p>"Answered&mdash;or, rather acknowledged&mdash;the receipt of young Reynolds's
Poem, Safie. The lad is clever, but much of his thoughts are
borrowed,&mdash;<i>whence</i>, the Reviewers may find out. I hate discouraging a
young one; and I think,&mdash;though wild and more oriental than he would be,
had he seen the scenes where he has placed his tale,&mdash;that he has much
talent, and, certainly, fire enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>Pg 7</span>"Received a very singular epistle; and the mode of its conveyance,
through Lord H.'s hands, as curious as the letter itself. But it was
gratifying and pretty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Sunday, February 27.</p>

<p>"Here I am, alone, instead of dining at Lord H.'s, where I was
asked,&mdash;but not inclined to go anywhere. Hobhouse says I am growing a
<i>loup garou</i>,&mdash;a solitary hobgoblin. True;&mdash;'I am myself alone.' The
last week has been passed in reading&mdash;seeing plays&mdash;now and then
visiters&mdash;sometimes yawning and sometimes sighing, but no writing,&mdash;save
of letters. If I could always read, I should never feel the want of
society. Do I regret it?&mdash;um!&mdash;'Man delights not me,' and only one
woman&mdash;at a time.</p>

<p>"There is something to me very softening in the presence of a
woman,&mdash;some strange influence, even if one is not in love with
them,&mdash;which I cannot at all account for, having no very high opinion of
the sex. But yet,&mdash;I always feel in better humour with myself and every
thing else, if there is a woman within ken. Even Mrs. Mule<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, my
fire-<span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>Pg 8</span>lighter,&mdash;the most ancient and withered of her kind,&mdash;and (except
to myself) not the best-tempered&mdash;always makes me laugh,&mdash;no difficult
task when I am 'i' the vein.'</p>

<p>"Heigho! I would I were in mine island!&mdash;I am not well; and yet I look
in good health. At times, I fear, 'I am not in my perfect mind;'&mdash;and
yet my heart and head have stood many a crash, and what should ail them
now? They prey upon themselves, and I am sick&mdash;sick&mdash;'Prithee, undo this
button&mdash;why should a cat, a rat, a dog have life&mdash;and <i>thou</i> no life at
all?' Six-and-twenty years, as they call them, why, I might and should
have been a Pasha by this time. 'I 'gin to be a weary of the sun.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>Pg 9</span>"Buonaparte is not yet beaten; but has rebutted Blucher, and repiqued
Swartzenburg. This it is to have a head. If he again wins, 'V&aelig; victis!'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Sunday, March 6.</p>

<p>"On Tuesday last dined with Rogers,&mdash;Madame de Sta&euml;l, Mackintosh,
Sheridan, Erskine, and Payne Knight, Lady Donegall and Miss R. there.
Sheridan told a very good story of himself and Madame de Recamier's
handkerchief; Erskine a few stories of himself only. <i>She</i> is going to
write a big book about England, she says;&mdash;I believe her. Asked by her
how I liked Miss * *'s thing, called * *, and answered (very sincerely)
that I thought it very bad for <i>her</i>, and worse than any of the others.
Afterwards thought it possible Lady Donegall, being Irish, might be a
patroness of * *, and was rather sorry for my opinion, as I hate putting
people into fusses, either with themselves or their favourites; it looks
as if one did it on purpose. The party went off very well, and the fish
was very much to my gusto. But we got up too soon after the women; and
Mrs. Corinne always lingers so long after dinner that we wish her
in&mdash;the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"To-day C. called, and while sitting here, in came Merivale. During our
colloquy, C.(ignorant that M. was the writer) abused the 'mawkishness of
the Quarterly Review of Grimm's Correspondence.' I (knowing the secret)
changed the conversation as soon as I could; and C. went away, quite
convinced of having made the most favourable impression on his new
acquaintance. Merivale is luckily a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>Pg 10</span> good-natured fellow, or, God
he knows what might have been engendered from such a malaprop. I did not
look at him while this was going on, but I felt like a coal&mdash;for I like
Merivale, as well as the article in question.</p>

<p>"Asked to Lady Keith's to-morrow evening&mdash;I think I will go; but it is
the first party invitation I have accepted this 'season,' as the learned
Fletcher called it, when that youngest brat of Lady * *'s cut my eye and
cheek open with a misdirected pebble&mdash;'Never mind, my Lord, the scar
will be gone before the <i>season</i>;' as if one's eye was of no importance
in the mean time.</p>

<p>"Lord Erskine called, and gave me his famous pamphlet, with a marginal
note and corrections in his handwriting. Sent it to be bound superbly,
and shall treasure it.</p>

<p>"Sent my fine print of Napoleon to be framed. It <i>is</i> framed; and the
Emperor becomes his robes as if he had been hatched in them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"March 7.</p>

<p>"Rose at seven&mdash;ready by half-past eight&mdash;went to Mr. Hanson's, Berkeley
Square&mdash;went to church with his eldest daughter, Mary Anne (a good
girl), and gave her away to the Earl of Portsmouth. Saw her fairly a
countess&mdash;congratulated the family and groom (bride)&mdash;drank a bumper of
wine (wholesome sherris) to their felicity, and all that&mdash;and came home.
Asked to stay to dinner, but could not. At three sat to Phillips for
faces. Called on Lady M.&mdash;I like her so well, that I always stay too
long. (Mem. to mend of that.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>Pg 11</span>"Passed the evening with Hobhouse, who has begun a poem, which promises
highly;&mdash;wish he would go on with it. Heard some curious extracts from a
life of Morosini, the blundering Venetian, who blew up the Acropolis at
Athens with a bomb, and be d&mdash;&mdash;d to him! Waxed sleepy&mdash;just come
home&mdash;must go to bed, and am engaged to meet Sheridan to-morrow at
Rogers's.</p>

<p>"Queer ceremony that same of marriage&mdash;saw many abroad, Greek and
Catholic&mdash;one, at <i>home</i>, many years ago. There be some strange phrases
in the prologue (the exhortation), which made me turn away, not to laugh
in the face of the surpliceman. Made one blunder, when I joined the
hands of the happy&mdash;rammed their left hands, by mistake, into one
another. Corrected it&mdash;bustled back to the altar-rail, and said 'Amen.'
Portsmouth responded as if he had got the whole by heart; and, if any
thing, was rather before the priest. It is now midnight, and * * *.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"March 10. Thor's Day.</p>

<p>"On Tuesday dined with Rogers,&mdash;Mackintosh, Sheridan, Sharpe,&mdash;much
talk, and good,&mdash;all, except my own little prattlement. Much of old
times&mdash;Horne Tooke&mdash;the Trials&mdash;evidence of Sheridan, and anecdotes of
those times, when <i>I</i>, alas! was an infant. If I had been a man, I would
have made an English Lord Edward Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>"Set down Sheridan at Brookes's,&mdash;where, by the by, he could not have
well set down himself, as he and I were the only drinkers. Sherry means
to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>Pg 12</span> stand for Westminster, as Cochrane (the stock-jobbing hoaxer) must
vacate. Brougham is a candidate. I fear for poor dear Sherry. Both have
talents of the highest order, but the youngster has <i>yet</i> a character.
We shall see, if he lives to Sherry's age, how he will pass over the
redhot ploughshares of public life. I don't know why, but I hate to see
the <i>old</i> ones lose; particularly Sheridan, notwithstanding all his
<i>m&eacute;chancet&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>"Received many, and the kindest, thanks from Lady Portsmouth, <i>p&egrave;re</i> and
<i>m&egrave;re</i>, for my match-making. I don't regret it, as she looks the
countess well, and is a very good girl. It is odd how well she carries
her new honours. She looks a different woman, and high-bred, too. I had
no idea that I could make so good a peeress.</p>

<p>"Went to the play with Hobhouse. Mrs. Jordan superlative in Hoyden, and
Jones well enough in Foppington. <i>What plays!</i> what wit!&mdash;helas!
Congreve and Vanbrugh are your only comedy. Our society is too insipid
now for the like copy. Would <i>not</i> go to Lady Keith's. Hobhouse thought
it odd. I wonder <i>he</i> should like parties. If one is in love, and wants
to break a commandment and covet any thing that is there, they do very
well. But to go out amongst the mere herd, without a motive, pleasure,
or pursuit&mdash;'sdeath! 'I'll none of it.' He told me an odd report,&mdash;that
<i>I</i> am the actual Conrad, the veritable Corsair, and that part of my
travels are supposed to have passed in privacy. Um!&mdash;people sometimes
hit near the truth; but never the whole truth. H. don't know what I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page13" name="page13"></a>Pg 13</span>
about the year after he left the Levant; nor does any
one&mdash;nor&mdash;nor&mdash;nor&mdash;however, it is a lie&mdash;but, 'I doubt the equivocation
of the fiend that lies like truth!'</p>

<p>"I shall have letters of importance to-morrow. Which, * *, * *, or * *?
heigho!&mdash;* * is in my heart, * * in my head, * * in my eye, and the
<i>single</i> one, Heaven knows where. All write, and will be answered.
'Since I have crept in favour with myself, I must maintain it;' but <i>I</i>
never 'mistook my person,' though I think others have.</p>

<p>"* * called to-day in great despair about his mistress, who has taken a
freak of * * *. He began a letter to her, but was obliged to stop
short&mdash;I finished it for him, and he copied and sent it. If he holds
out, and keeps to my instructions of affected indifference, she will
lower her colours. If she don't, he will, at least, get rid of her, and
she don't seem much worth keeping. But the poor lad is in love&mdash;if that
is the case, she will win. When they once discover their power, <i>finita
e la musica</i>.</p>

<p>"Sleepy, and must go to bed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Tuesday, March 15.</p>

<p>"Dined yesterday with R., Mackintosh, and Sharpe. Sheridan could not
come. Sharpe told several very amusing anecdotes of Henderson, the
actor. Stayed till late, and came home, having drank so much <i>tea</i>, that
I did not get to sleep till six this morning. R. says I am to be in
<i>this</i> Quarterly&mdash;cut up, I presume, as they 'hate us youth.'
<i>N'importe</i>. As Sharpe was passing by the doors of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name="page14"></a>Pg 14</span> some debating
society (the Westminster Forum), in his way to dinner, he saw rubricked
on the walls <i>Scott</i>'s name and <i>mine</i>&mdash;'Which the best poet?' being the
question of the evening; and I suppose all the Templars and <i>would bes</i>
took our rhymes in vain, in the course of the controversy. Which had the
greater show of hands, I neither know nor care; but I feel the coupling
of the names as a compliment,&mdash;though I think Scott deserves better
company.</p>

<p>"W.W. called&mdash;Lord Erskine, Lord Holland, &amp;c. &amp;c. Wrote to * * the
Corsair report. She says she don't wonder, since 'Conrad is so <i>like</i>.'
It is odd that one, who knows me so thoroughly, should tell me this to
my face. However, if she don't know, nobody can.</p>

<p>"Mackintosh is, it seems, the writer of the defensive letter in the
Morning Chronicle. If so, it is very kind, and more than I did for
myself.</p>

<p>"Told Murray to secure for me Bandello's Italian Novels at the sale
to-morrow. To me they will be <i>nuts</i>. Redde a satire on myself, called
'Anti-Byron,' and told Murray to publish it if he liked. The object of
the author is to prove me an atheist and a systematic conspirator
against law and government. Some of the verse is good; the prose I don't
quite understand. He asserts that my 'deleterious works' have had 'an
effect upon civil society, which requires,' &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and his own
poetry. It is a lengthy poem, and a long preface, with a harmonious
title-page. Like the fly in the fable, I seem to have got upon a wheel
which makes much dust; but, un<span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>Pg 15</span>like the said fly, I do not take it all
for my own raising.</p>

<p>"A letter from <i>Bella</i>, which I answered. I shall be in love with her
again, if I don't take care.</p>

<p>"I shall begin a more regular system of reading soon.</p>

<p>"Thursday, March 17.</p>

<p>"I have been sparring with Jackson for exercise this morning; and mean
to continue and renew my acquaintance with the muffles. My chest, and
arms, and wind are in very good plight, and I am not in flesh. I used to
be a hard hitter, and my arms are very long for my height (5 feet 8-1/2
inches). At any rate, exercise is good, and this the severest of all;
fencing and the broad-sword never fatigued me half so much.</p>

<p>"Redde the 'Quarrels of Authors' (another sort of <i>sparring</i>)&mdash;a new
work, by that most entertaining and researching writer, Israeli. They
seem to be an irritable set, and I wish myself well out of it. 'I'll not
march through Coventry with them, that's flat.' What the devil had I to
do with scribbling? It is too late to enquire, and all regret is
useless. But, an' it were to do again,&mdash;I should write again, I suppose.
Such is human nature, at least my share of it;&mdash;though I shall think
better of myself, if I have sense to stop now. If I have a wife, and
that wife has a son&mdash;by any body&mdash;I will bring up mine heir in the most
anti-poetical way&mdash;make him a lawyer, or a pirate, or&mdash;any thing. But,
if he writes too, I shall be sure he is none of mine, and cut him off
with a Bank token. Must write a letter&mdash;three o'clock.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>Pg 16</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Sunday, March 20.</p>

<p>"I intended to go to Lady Hardwicke's, but won't. I always begin the day
with a bias towards going to parties; but, as the evening advances, my
stimulus fails, and I hardly ever go out&mdash;and, when I do, always regret
it. This might have been a pleasant one;&mdash;at least, the hostess is a
very superior woman. Lady Lansdowne's to morrow&mdash;Lady Heathcote's
Wednesday. Um!&mdash;I must spur myself into going to some of them, or it
will look like rudeness, and it is better to do as other people
do&mdash;confound them!</p>

<p>"Redde Machiavel, parts of Chardin, and Sismondi, and Bandello&mdash;by
starts. Redde the Edinburgh, 44, just come out. In the beginning of the
article on 'Edgeworth's Patronage,' I have gotten a high compliment, I
perceive. Whether this is creditable to me, I know not; but it does
honour to the editor, because he once abused me. Many a man will retract
praise; none but a high-spirited mind will revoke its censure, or <i>can</i>
praise the man it has once attacked. I have often, since my return to
England, heard Jeffrey most highly commended by those who know him for
things independent of his talents. I admire him for <i>this</i>&mdash;not because
he has <i>praised me</i>, (I have been so praised elsewhere and abused,
alternately, that mere habit has rendered me as indifferent to both as a
man at twenty-six can be to any thing,) but because he is, perhaps, the
<i>only man</i> who, under the relations in which he and I stand, or stood,
with regard to each other, would have had the liberality to act thus;
none but a great soul dared hazard it. The height on which he stands<span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>Pg 17</span>
has not made him giddy:&mdash;a little scribbler would have gone on cavilling
to the end of the chapter. As to the justice of his panegyric, that is
matter of taste. There are plenty to question it, and glad, too, of the
opportunity.</p>

<p>"Lord Erskine called to-day. He means to carry down his reflections on
the war&mdash;or rather wars&mdash;to the present day. I trust that he will. Must
send to Mr. Murray to get the binding of my copy of his pamphlet
finished, as Lord E. has promised me to correct it, and add some
marginal notes to it. Any thing in his handwriting will be a treasure,
which will gather compound interest from years. Erskine has high
expectations of Mackintosh's promised History. Undoubtedly it must be a
classic, when finished.</p>

<p>"Sparred with Jackson again yesterday morning, and shall to-morrow. I
feel all the better for it, in spirits, though my arms and shoulders are
very stiff from it. Mem. to attend the pugilistic dinner:&mdash;Marquess
Huntley is in the chair.</p>

<p>"Lord Erskine thinks that ministers must be in peril of going out. So
much the better for him. To me it is the same who are in or out;&mdash;we
want something more than a change of ministers, and some day we will
have it.</p>

<p>"I remember<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, in riding from Chrisso to Castri (Delphos), along the
sides of Parnassus, I saw six <span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>Pg 18</span>eagles in the air. It is uncommon to see
so many together; and it was the number&mdash;not the species, which is
common enough&mdash;that excited my attention.</p>

<p>"The last bird I ever fired at was an <i>eaglet</i>, on the shore of the Gulf
of Lepanto, near Vostitza. It was only wounded, and I tried to save it,
the eye was so bright; but it pined, and died in a few days; and I never
did since, and never will, attempt the death of another bird. I wonder
what put these two things into my head just now? I have been reading
Sismondi, and there is nothing there that could induce the recollection.</p>

<p>"I am mightily taken with Braccio di Montone, Giovanni Galeazzo, and
Eccelino. But the last is <i>not</i> Bracciaferro (of the same name), Count
of Ravenna, whose history I want to trace. There is a fine engraving in
Lavater, from a picture by Fuseli, of <i>that</i> Ezzelin, over the body of
Meduna, punished by him for a <i>hitch</i> in her constancy during his
absence in the Crusades. He was right&mdash;but I want to know the story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Tuesday, March 22.</p>

<p>"Last night, <i>party</i> at Lansdowne House. To-night, <i>party</i> at Lady
Charlotte Greville's&mdash;deplorable waste of time, and something of temper.
Nothing imparted&mdash;nothing acquired&mdash;talking without ideas:&mdash;if any thing
like <i>thought</i> in my mind, it was not on the subjects on which we were
gabbling. Heigho!&mdash;and in this way half London pass what is called life.
To-morrow there is Lady Heathcote's&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page19" name="page19"></a>Pg 19</span>shall I go? yes&mdash;to punish myself
for not having a pursuit.</p>

<p>"Let me see&mdash;what did I see? The only person who much struck me was Lady
S* *d's eldest daughter, Lady C.L. They say she is <i>not</i> pretty. I don't
know&mdash;every thing is pretty that pleases; but there is an air of <i>soul</i>
about her&mdash;and her colour changes&mdash;and there is that shyness of the
antelope (which I delight in) in her manner so much, that I observed her
more than I did any other woman in the rooms, and only looked at any
thing else when I thought she might perceive and feel embarrassed by my
scrutiny. After all, there may be something of association in this. She
is a friend of Augusta's, and whatever she loves I can't help liking.</p>

<p>"Her mother, the Marchioness, talked to me a little; and I was twenty
times on the point of asking her to introduce me to <i>sa fille</i>, but I
stopped short. This comes of that affray with the Carlisles.</p>

<p>"Earl Grey told me laughingly of a paragraph in the last <i>Moniteur</i>,
which has stated, among other symptoms of rebellion, some particulars of
the <i>sensation</i> occasioned in all our government gazettes by the 'tear'
lines,&mdash;<i>only</i> amplifying, in its re-statement, an epigram (by the by,
no epigram except in the <i>Greek</i> acceptation of the word) into a
<i>roman</i>. I wonder the Couriers, &amp;c. &amp;c., have not translated that part
of the Moniteur, with additional comments.</p>

<p>"The Princess of Wales has requested Fuseli to paint from 'The
Corsair,'&mdash;leaving to him the choice of any passage for the subject: so
Mr. Locke tells<span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>Pg 20</span> me. Tired, jaded, selfish, and supine&mdash;must go to bed.</p>

<p>"<i>Roman</i>, at least <i>Romance</i>, means a song sometimes, as in the Spanish.
I suppose this is the Moniteur's meaning, unless he has confused it with
'The Corsair.'</p>

<p>"Albany, March 28.</p>

<p>"This night got into my new apartments, rented of Lord Althorpe, on a
lease of seven years. Spacious, and room for my books and sabres. <i>In</i>
the <i>house</i>, too, another advantage. The last few days, or whole week,
have been very abstemious, regular in exercise, and yet very <i>un</i>well.</p>

<p>"Yesterday, dined <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> at the Cocoa with Scrope Davies&mdash;sat
from six till midnight&mdash;drank between us one bottle of champagne and six
of claret, neither of which wines ever affect me. Offered to take Scrope
home in my carriage; but he was tipsy and pious, and I was obliged to
leave him on his knees praying to I know not what purpose or pagod. No
headach, nor sickness, that night nor to-day. Got up, if any thing,
earlier than usual&mdash;sparred with Jackson <i>ad sudorem</i>, and have been
much better in health than for many days. I have heard nothing more from
Scrope. Yesterday paid him four thousand eight hundred pounds, a debt of
some standing, and which I wished to have paid before. My mind is much
relieved by the removal of that <i>debit</i>.</p>

<p>"Augusta wants me to make it up with Carlisle. I have refused <i>every</i>
body else, but I can't deny her any thing;&mdash;so I must e'en do it, though
I had as<span class="pagenum"><a id="page21" name="page21"></a>Pg 21</span> lief 'drink up Eisel&mdash;eat a crocodile.' Let me see&mdash;Ward, the
Hollands, the Lambs, Rogers, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;every body, more or less, have
been trying for the last two years to accommodate this <i>couplet</i> quarrel
to no purpose. I shall laugh if Augusta succeeds.</p>

<p>"Redde a little of many things&mdash;shall get in all my books to-morrow.
Luckily this room will hold them&mdash;with 'ample room and verge, &amp;c. the
characters of hell to trace.' I must set about some employment soon; my
heart begins to eat <i>itself</i> again.</p>

<p>"April 8.</p>

<p>"Out of town six days. On my return, find my poor little pagod,
Napoleon, pushed off his pedestal;&mdash;the thieves are in Paris. It is his
own fault. Like Milo, he would rend the oak<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>; but it closed again,
wedged his hands, and now the beasts&mdash;lion, bear, down to the dirtiest

<p>"I mark this day!</p>

<p>"Napoleon Buonaparte has abdicated the throne <span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>Pg 22</span>of the world. 'Excellent
well.' Methinks Sylla did better; for he revenged and resigned in the
height of his sway, red with the slaughter of his foes&mdash;the finest
instance of glorious contempt of the rascals upon record. Dioclesian did
well too&mdash;Amurath not amiss, had he become aught except a
dervise&mdash;Charles the Fifth but so so&mdash;but Napoleon, worst of all. What!
wait till they were in his capital, and then talk of his readiness to
give up what is already gone!! 'What whining monk art thou&mdash;what holy
cheat?' 'Sdeath!&mdash;Dionysius at Corinth was yet a king to this. The 'Isle
of Elba' to retire to!&mdash;Well&mdash;if it had been Caprea, I should have
marvelled less. 'I see men's minds are but a parcel of their fortunes.'
I am utterly bewildered and confounded.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;but I think <i>I</i>, even <i>I</i> (an insect compared with this
creature), have set my life on casts not a millionth part of this man's.
But, after all, a crown may be not worth dying for. Yet, to outlive
<i>Lodi</i> for this!!! Oh that Juvenal or Johnson could rise from the dead!
'Expende&mdash;quot libras in duce summo invenies?' I knew they were light in
the balance of mortality; but I thought their living dust weighed more

hardly fit to stick in a glazier's pencil:&mdash;the pen of the historian
won't rate it worth a ducat.</p>

past: but I have sparred for exercise (windows open) with Jackson an
hour daily, to attenuate and keep up the ethereal part of me. The more
violent the fatigue, the better my spirits for the rest of the day; and
then, my evenings have that calm nothingness of languor, which I most
delight in. To-day I have boxed one hour&mdash;written an ode to Napoleon
Buonaparte&mdash;copied it&mdash;eaten six biscuits&mdash;drunk four bottles of soda

<p>"I have got a devil of a long story in the press, entitled 'The
Corsair,' in the regular heroic measure. It is a pirate's isle,
peopled with my own creatures, and you may easily suppose they do a
world of mischief through the three cantos. Now for your
dedication&mdash;if you will accept it. This is positively my last
experiment on public <i>literary</i> opinion, till I turn my thirtieth
year,&mdash;if so be I flourish<span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>Pg 27</span> until that downhill period. I have a
confidence for you&mdash;a perplexing one to me, and, just at present,
in a state of abeyance in itself.</p>

which I shall fill up with as few thoughts of my own as I can
borrow from other people. Any thing is better than stagnation; and
now, in the interregnum of my autumn and a strange summer
adventure, which I don't like to think of, (I don't mean * *'s,

Mr. Moore has seen, and decidedly preferred the part your Tory bile

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Newstead Abbey, January 22. 1814.</p>

<p>"You will be glad to hear of my safe arrival here. The time of my
return will depend upon the weather, which is so impracticable,
that this letter has to advance through more snows than ever
opposed the Emperor's retreat. The roads are impassable, and return
impossible for the present; which I do not regret, as I am much at
my ease, and <i>six-and-twenty</i> complete this day&mdash;a very pretty age,
if it would always last. Our coals are excellent, our fire-places
large, my cellar full, and my head empty; and I have not yet
recovered my joy at leaving London. If any unexpected turn occurred
with my purchasers, I believe I should hardly quit the place at
all; but shut my door, and let my beard grow.</p>

<p>"I forgot to mention (and I hope it is unnecessary) that the lines
beginning&mdash;<i>Remember him</i>, &amp;c. must <i>not</i> appear with <i>The
Corsair</i>. You may slip them in with the smaller pieces newly
annexed to <i>Childe Harold</i>; but on no account permit them to be
appended to The Corsair. Have the goodness to recollect this
particularly.</p>

<p>"The books I have brought with me are a great consolation for the
confinement, and I bought more as we came along. In short, I never
consult the thermometer, and shall not put up prayers for a <i>thaw</i>,
unless I thought it would sweep away the rascally invaders of
France. Was ever such a thing as Blucher's proclamation?</p>

<p>"Just before I left town, Kemble paid me the compliment of desiring
me to write a <i>tragedy</i>; I wish<span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>Pg 34</span> I could, but I find my scribbling
mood subsiding&mdash;not before it was time; but it is lucky to check it
at all. If I lengthen my letter, you will think it is coming on
again; so, good-by. Yours alway,</p>

<p>"B.</p>

<p>"P.S. If you hear any news of battle or retreat on the part of the
Allies (as they call them), pray send it. He has my best wishes to
manure the fields of France with an <i>invading</i> army. I hate
invaders of all countries, and have no patience with the cowardly
cry of exultation over him, at whose name you all turned whiter
than the snow to which you are indebted for your triumphs.</p>

<p>"I open my letter to thank you for yours just received. The 'Lines
to a Lady Weeping' must go with The Corsair. I care nothing for
consequence, on this point. My politics are to me like a young
mistress to an old man&mdash;the worse they grow, the fonder I become of
them. As Mr. Gilford likes the 'Portuguese Translation<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>,' pray
insert it as an addition to The Corsair.</p>

<p>"In all points of difference between Mr. Gifford and Mr. Dallas,
let the first keep his place; and in all points of difference
between Mr. Gifford and Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>Pg 35</span>Anybody-else, I shall abide by the
former; if I am wrong, I can't help it. But I would rather not be
right with any other person. So there is an end of that matter.
After all the trouble he has taken about me and mine, I should be
very ungrateful to feel or act otherwise. Besides, in point of
judgment, he is not to be lowered by a comparison. In <i>politics</i>,
he may be right too; but that with me is a <i>feeling</i>, and I can't

<i>was</i> and am quite in earnest in my prefatory promise not to
intrude any more; and this not from any affectation, but a thorough
conviction that it is the best policy, and is at least respectful
to my readers, as it shows that I would not willingly run the risk
of forfeiting <span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>Pg 36</span>their favour in future. Besides, I have other views
and objects, and think that I shall keep this resolution; for,
since I left London, though shut up, <i>snow</i>-bound, <i>thaw</i>-bound,
and tempted with all kinds of paper, the dirtiest of ink, and the
bluntest of pens, I have not even been haunted by a wish to put
them to their combined uses, except in letters of business. My
rhyming propensity is quite gone, and I feel much as I did at
Patras on recovering from my fever&mdash;weak, but in health, and only
afraid of a relapse. I do most fervently hope I never shall.</p>

<p>"I see by the Morning Chronicle there hath been discussion in the

<p>"You are to do as you please about the smaller poems; but I think
removing them <i>now</i> from The Corsair looks like <i>fear</i>; and if so,

assist the circulation of The Corsair; an object I should imagine
at <i>present</i> of more importance to <i>yourself</i> than Childe Harold's

that <i>poem</i> to draw any imputation of <i>dismay</i> upon me.</p>

highly, as you well know; it is in the approbation of such men that
fame becomes worth having. To Mr. Gifford I am always grate<span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name="page37"></a>Pg 37</span>ful,

<p>"I have been sauntering and dozing here very quietly, and not
unhappily. You will be happy to hear that I have completely
established my title-deeds as marketable, and that the purchaser
has succumbed to the terms, and fulfils them, or is to fulfil them
forthwith. He is now here, and we go on very amicably
together,&mdash;one in each <i>wing</i> of the Abbey. We set off on Sunday&mdash;I
for town, he for Cheshire.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Leigh is with me&mdash;much pleased with the place, and less so
with me for parting with it, to which not even the price can
reconcile her. Your parcel has not yet arrived&mdash;at least the

<p>"I believe both are very correctly printed, which is a great
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I thank you for wishing me in town; but I think one's success is
most felt at a distance, and I enjoy my solitary self-importance in
an agreeable sulky way of my own, upon the strength of your
letter&mdash;for which I once more thank you, and am, very truly, &amp;c.</p>

what you say.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> If so, he is a rascal, and a <i>shabby</i> rascal too;

enquiry here. Perhaps some <i>other</i> in town may have gone on
printing, and used the same deception.</p>

<p>"The <i>fac-simile</i> is omitted in Childe Harold, which is very
awkward, as there is a <i>note</i> expressly on the subject. Pray
<i>replace</i> it as <i>usual</i>.</p>

<p>"On second and third thoughts, the withdrawing the small poems from
The Corsair (even to add to Childe Harold) looks like shrinking and
shuffling after the fuss made upon one of them by the Tories. Pray
replace them in The Corsair's appendix. I am sorry that Childe
Harold requires some and such abetments to make him move off; but,
if you remember, I told you his popularity would not be permanent.
It is very lucky for the author that he had made up his mind to a
temporary reputation in time. The truth is, I do not think that any
of the present day (and least of all, one who has not consulted the
flattering side of human nature,) have much to hope from posterity;
and you may think it affectation very probably, but, to me, my
present and past success has appeared very singular, since it was
in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39"></a>Pg 39</span>teeth of so many prejudices. I almost think people like to
be contradicted. If Childe Harold flags, it will hardly be worth
while to go on with the engravings: but do as you please; I have
done with the whole concern; and the enclosed lines, written years
ago, and copied from my skull-cap, are among the last with which
you will be troubled. If you like, add them to Childe Harold, if
only for the sake of another outcry. You received so long an answer
yesterday, that I will not intrude on you further than to repeat
myself,</p>

<p>"P.S. Of course, in reprinting (if you have occasion), you will
take great care to be correct. The present editions seem very much

<i>responsible</i> occurs twice nearly together; correct the second into

Bedreddin in the 'Nights' says, 'for making a cream tart without

<p><b>LETTER 167. TO MR. DALLAS.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"February 17. 1814.</p>

<p>"The Courier of this evening accuses me of having 'received and
pocketed' large sums for my works. I have never yet received, nor
wish to receive, a farthing for any. Mr. Murray offered a thousand
for The Giaour and Bride of Abydos, which I said was too much, and
that if he could afford it at the end of six months, I would then
direct how it might be disposed of; but neither then, nor at any
other period, have I ever availed myself of the profits on my own
account. For the republication of the Satire I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>Pg 48</span>refused four
hundred guineas; and for the previous editions I never asked nor
received a <i>sous</i>, nor for any writing whatever. I do not wish you
to do any thing disagreeable to yourself; there never was nor shall
be any conditions nor stipulations with regard to any accommodation
that I could afford you; and, on your part, I can see nothing
derogatory in receiving the copyright. It was only assistance
afforded to a worthy man, by one not quite so worthy.</p>

<p>"Mr. Murray is going to contradict this<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>; but your name will
not be mentioned: for your own part, you are a free agent, and are
to do as you please. I only hope that now, as always, you will
think that I wish to take no unfair advantage of the accidental
opportunity which circumstances permitted me of being of use to
you. Ever," &amp;c.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In consequence of this letter, Mr. Dallas addressed an explanation to
one of the newspapers, of which the following is a part;&mdash;the remainder
being occupied with a rather clumsily managed defence of his noble
benefactor on the subject of the Stanzas.</p>

<p><b>TO THE EDITOR OF THE MORNING POST.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Sir,</p>

<p>"I have seen the paragraph in an evening paper, in which Lord Byron
is <i>accused</i> of 'receiving and pocketing' large sums for his works.
I believe no one who knows him has the slightest suspicion of this
kind; but the assertion being public, I think it a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page49" name="page49"></a>Pg 49</span>justice I owe
to Lord Byron to contradict it publicly. I address this letter to
you for that purpose, and I am happy that it gives me an
opportunity at this moment to make some observations which I have
for several days been anxious to do publicly, but from which I have
been restrained by an apprehension that I should be suspected of
being prompted by his Lordship.</p>

<p>"I take upon me to affirm, that Lord Byron never received a
shilling for any of his works. To my certain knowledge, the profits
of the Satire were left entirely to the publisher of it. The gift
of the copyright of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage I have already
publicly acknowledged in the dedication of the new edition of my
novels; and I now add my acknowledgment for that of The Corsair,
not only for the profitable part of it, but for the delicate and
delightful manner of bestowing it while yet unpublished. With
respect to his two other poems, The Giaour and The Bride of Abydos,
Mr. Murray, the publisher of them, can truly attest that no part of
the sale of them has ever touched his hands, or been disposed of
for his use. Having said thus much as to facts, I cannot but
express my surprise that it should ever be deemed a matter of
reproach that he should appropriate the pecuniary returns of his
works. Neither rank nor fortune seems to me to place any man above
this; for what difference does it make in honour and noble
feelings, whether a copyright be bestowed, or its value employed,
in beneficent purposes? I differ with my Lord Byron on this subject
as well as some others; and he has<span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name="page50"></a>Pg 50</span> constantly, both by word and
action, shown his aversion to receiving money for his productions."</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER. 163. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"February 26. 1814.</p>

<p>"Dallas had, perhaps, have better kept silence;&mdash;but that was <i>his</i>
concern, and, as his facts are correct, and his motive not
dishonourable to himself, I wished him well through it. As for his
interpretations of the lines, he and any one else may interpret
them as they please. I have and shall adhere to my taciturnity,
unless something very particular occurs to render this impossible.
Do <i>not you</i> say a word. If any one is to speak, it is the person
principally concerned. The most amusing thing is, that every one
(to me) attributes the abuse to the <i>man they personally most
dislike!</i>&mdash;some say C * * r, some C * * e, others F * * d, &amp;c. &amp;c.
&amp;c. I do not know, and have no clue but conjecture. If discovered,
and he turns out a hireling, he must be left to his wages; if a
cavalier, he must 'wink, and hold out his iron.'</p>

<p>"I had some thoughts of putting the question to C * * r, but H.,
who, I am sure, would not dissuade me if it were right, advised me
by all means <i>not</i>;&mdash;'that I had no right to take it upon
suspicion,' &amp;c. &amp;c. Whether H. is correct I am not aware, but he
believes himself so, and says there can be but one opinion on that
subject. This I am, at least, sure of, that he would never prevent
me from doing what he deemed the duty of a <i>preux</i> chevalier. In
such cases&mdash;at least, in this country&mdash;we must act ac<span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name="page51"></a>Pg 51</span>cording to
usages. In considering this instance, I dismiss my own personal
feelings. Any man will and must fight, when necessary,&mdash;even
without a motive. <i>Here</i>, I should take it up really without much
resentment; for, unless a woman one likes is in the way, it is some
years since I felt a <i>long</i> anger. But, undoubtedly, could I, or
may I, trace it to a man of station, I should and shall do what is
proper.</p>

<p>"* * was angerly, but tried to conceal it. <i>You</i> are not called
upon to avow the 'Twopenny,' and would only gratify them by so
doing. Do you not see the great object of all these fooleries is to
set him, and you, and me, and all persons whatsoever, by the
ears?&mdash;more especially those who are on good terms,&mdash;and nearly
succeeded. Lord H. wished me to <i>concede</i> to Lord Carlisle&mdash;concede
to the devil!&mdash;to a man who used me ill? I told him, in answer,
that I would neither concede, nor recede on the subject, but be
silent altogether; unless any thing more could be said about Lady
H. and himself, who had been since my very good friends;&mdash;and there
it ended. This was no time for concessions to Lord C.</p>

<p>"I have been interrupted, but shall write again soon. Believe me
ever, my dear Moore," &amp;c.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Another of his friends having expressed, soon after, some intention of
volunteering publicly in his defence, he lost no time in repressing him
by the following sensible letter:&mdash;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name="page52"></a>Pg 52</span></p>

<p><b>LETTER 169. TO W * * W * *, ESQ.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"February 28. 1814.</p>

<p>"My dear W.,</p>

<p>"I have but a few moments to write to you. <i>Silence</i> is the only
answer to the things you mention; nor should I regard that man as
my friend who said a word more on the subject. I care little for
attacks, but I will not submit to <i>defences</i>; and I do hope and
trust that <i>you</i> have never entertained a serious thought of
engaging in so foolish a controversy. Dallas's letter was, to his
credit, merely as to facts which he had a right to state; <i>I</i>
neither have nor shall take the least <i>public</i> notice, nor permit
any one else to do so. If I discover the writer, then I may act in
a different manner; but it will not be in writing.</p>

<p>"An expression in your letter has induced me to write this to you,
to entreat you not to interfere in any way in such a business,&mdash;it
is now nearly over, and depend upon it <i>they</i> are much more
chagrined by my silence than they could be by the best defence in
the world. I do not know any thing that would vex me more than any
further reply to these things.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 170. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"March 3. 1814.</p>

<p>"My dear Friend,</p>

<p>"I have a great mind to tell you that I <i>am</i> 'uncomfortable,' if
only to make you come to town; where no one ever more delighted in
seeing you, nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53"></a>Pg 53</span> is there any one to whom I would sooner turn for
consolation in my most vapourish moments. The truth is, I have 'no
lack of argument' to ponder upon of the most gloomy description,
but this arises from <i>other</i> causes. Some day or other, when we are
<i>veterans</i>, I may tell you a tale of present and past times; and it
is not from want of confidence that I do not now,&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;always
a <i>but</i> to the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>"There is nothing, however, upon the <i>spot</i> either to love or
hate;&mdash;but I certainly have subjects for both at no very great
distance, and am besides embarrassed between <i>three</i> whom I know,
and one (whose name, at least,) I do not know. All this would be
very well if I had no heart; but, unluckily, I have found that
there is such a thing still about me, though in no very good
repair, and, also, that it has a habit of attaching itself to <i>one</i>
whether I will or no. 'Divide et impera,' I begin to think, will
only do for politics.</p>

<p>"If I discover the 'toad' as you call him, I shall 'tread,'&mdash;and
put spikes in my shoes to do it more effectually. The effect of all
these fine things I do not enquire much nor perceive. I believe * *
felt them more than either of us. People are civil enough, and I
have had no dearth of invitations,&mdash;none of which, however, I have
accepted. I went out very little last year, and mean to go about
still less. I have no passion for circles, and have long regretted
that I ever gave way to what is called a town life;&mdash;which, of all
the lives I ever saw (and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="page54" name="page54"></a>Pg 54</span> are nearly as many as Plutarch's),
seems to me to leave the least for the past and future.</p>

<p>"How proceeds the poem? Do not neglect it, and I have no fears. I
need not say to you that your fame is dear to me,&mdash;I really might
say <i>dearer</i> than my own; for I have lately begun to think my
things have been strangely over-rated; and, at any rate, whether or
not, I have done with them for ever. I may say to you what I would
not say to every body, that the last two were written, The Bride in
four, and The Corsair in ten days<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>,&mdash;which I take to be a most
humiliating confession, as it proves my own want of judgment in
publishing, and the public's in reading things, which cannot have
stamina for permanent attention. 'So much for Buckingham.'</p>

<p>"I have no dread of your being too hasty, and I have still less of
your failing. But I think a <i>year</i> a very fair allotment of time to
a composition which is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page55" name="page55"></a>Pg 55</span>not to be Epic; and even Horace's 'Nonum
prematur' must have been intended for the Millennium, or some
longer-lived generation than ours. I wonder how much we should have
had of <i>him</i>, had he observed his own doctrines to the letter.
Peace be with you! Remember that I am always and most truly yours,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. I never heard the 'report' you mention, nor, I dare say, many
others. But, in course, you, as well as others, have 'damned
good-natured friends,' who do their duty in the usual way. One
thing will make you laugh. * * * *"</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER 171. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"March 12. 1814.</p>

<p>"Guess darkly, and you will seldom err. At present, I shall say no
more, and, perhaps&mdash;but no matter. I hope we shall some day meet,
and whatever years may precede or succeed it, I shall mark it with
the 'white stone' in my calendar. I am not sure that I shall not
soon be in your neighbourhood again. If so, and I am alone (as will
probably be the case), I shall invade and carry you off, and
endeavour to atone for sorry fare by a sincere welcome. I don't
know the person absent (barring 'the sect') I should be so glad to
see again.</p>

<p>"I have nothing of the sort you mention but <i>the lines</i> (the
Weepers), if you like to have them in the Bag. I wish to give them
all possible circulation. The <i>Vault</i> reflection is downright
actionable, and to print it would be peril to the publisher; but I
think the Tears have a natural right to be bagged, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page56" name="page56"></a>Pg 56</span> editor
(whoever he may be) might supply a facetious note or not, as he
pleased.</p>

<p>"I cannot conceive how the <i>Vault</i><a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> has got about,&mdash;but so it
is. It is too <i>farouche</i>; but, truth to say, my satires are not
very playful. I have the plan of an epistle in my head, <i>at</i> him
and <i>to</i> him; and, if they are not a little quieter, I shall embody
it. I should say little or nothing of <i>myself</i>. As to mirth and
ridicule, that is out of my way; but I have a tolerable fund of
sternness and contempt, and, with Juvenal before me, I shall
perhaps read him a lecture he has not lately heard in the C&mdash;&mdash;t.
From particular circumstances, which came to my knowledge almost by
accident, I could 'tell him what he is&mdash;I know him well.'</p>

<p>"I meant, my dear M., to write to you a long letter, but I am
hurried, and time clips my inclination down to yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. <i>Think again</i> before you <i>shelf</i> your poem. There is a
youngster, (older than me, by the by, but a younger poet,) Mr. G.
Knight, with a vol. of Eastern Tales, written since his
return,&mdash;for he has been in the countries. He sent to me last
summer, and I advised him to write one in <i>each measure</i>, without
any intention, at that time, of doing the same thing. Since that,
from a habit of writing in a fever, I have anticipated him in the
variety of measures, but quite unintentionally. Of the stories, I
know<span class="pagenum"><a id="page57" name="page57"></a>Pg 57</span> nothing, not having seen them<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>; but he has some lady in a
sack, too, like The Giaour:&mdash;he told me at the time.</p>

<p>"The best way to make the public 'forget' me is to remind them of
yourself. You cannot suppose that <i>I</i> would ask you or advise you
to publish, if I thought you would <i>fail</i>. I really have <i>no</i>
literary envy; and I do not believe a friend's success ever sat
nearer another than yours do to my best wishes. It is for <i>elderly
gentlemen</i> to 'bear no brother near,' and cannot become our disease
for more years than we may perhaps number. I wish you to be out
before Eastern subjects are again before the public."</p></div>

<p>"I have not time to read the whole MS.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, but what I have seen
seems very well written (both <i>prose</i> and <i>verse</i>), and, though I
am and can be no judge (at least a fair one on this subject),
containing nothing which you <i>ought</i> to hesitate publishing upon
<i>my</i> account. If the author is not Dr. <i>Busby</i> himself, I think it
a pity, on his <i>own</i> account, that he should <span class="pagenum"><a id="page58" name="page58"></a>Pg 58</span>dedicate it to his
subscribers; nor can I perceive what Dr. Busby has to do with the
matter except as a translator of Lucretius, for whose doctrines he
is surely not responsible. I tell you openly, and really most
sincerely, that, if published at all, there is no earthly reason
why you should <i>not</i>; on the contrary, I should receive it as the
greatest compliment <i>you</i> could pay to your good opinion of my
candour, to print and circulate that or any other work, attacking
me in a manly manner, and without any malicious intention, from
which, as far as I have seen, I must exonerate this writer.</p>

success: his verse is very deserving of it; and I shall be the last
person to suspect his motives. Yours, &amp;c.</p>

suppose me so narrow-minded as to shrink from discussion. I repeat
once for all, that I think it a good poem (as far as I have redde);

spacious bachelor apartments in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page60" name="page60"></a>Pg 60</span> Albany, to which you will, I hope,
address a speedy answer to this mine epistle.</p>

<p>"I am but just returned to town, from which you may infer that I
have been out of it; and I have been boxing, for exercise, with
Jackson for this last month daily. I have also been drinking, and,
on one occasion, with three other friends at the Cocoa Tree, from
six till four, yea, unto five in the matin. We clareted and
champagned till two&mdash;then supped, and finished with a kind of
regency punch composed of madeira, brandy, and <i>green</i> tea, no
<i>real</i> water being admitted therein. There was a night for you!
without once quitting the table, except to ambulate home, which I
did alone, and in utter contempt of a hackney-coach and my own
<i>vis</i>, both of which were deemed necessary for our conveyance. And
so,&mdash;I am very well, and they say it will hurt my constitution.</p>

<p>"I have also, more or less, been breaking a few of the favourite
commandments; but I mean to pull up and marry, if any one will have
me. In the mean time, the other day I nearly killed myself with a
collar of brawn, which I swallowed for supper, and <i>in</i>digested for
I don't know how long: but that is by the by. All this gourmandise
was in honour of Lent; for I am forbidden meat all the rest of the
year, but it is strictly enjoined me during your solemn fast. I
have been, and am, in very tolerable love; but of that hereafter as
it may be.</p>

<p>"My dear Moore, say what you will in your preface; and quiz any
thing or any body,&mdash;me if you like it. Oons! dost thou think me of
the <i>old</i>, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>Pg 61</span> rather <i>elderly</i>, school? If one can't jest with
one's friends, with whom can we be facetious? You have nothing to
fear from * *, whom I have not seen, being out of town when he
called. He will be very correct, smooth, and all that, but I doubt
whether there will be any 'grace beyond the reach of art;'&mdash;and,
whether there is or not, how long will you be so d&mdash;&mdash;d modest? As
for Jeffrey, it is a very handsome thing of him to speak well of an
old antagonist,&mdash;and what a mean mind dared not do. Any one will
revoke praise; but&mdash;were it not partly my own case&mdash;I should say
that very few have strength of mind to unsay their censure, or
follow it up with praise of other things.</p>

<p>"What think you of the review of <i>Levis</i>? It beats the Bag and my
hand-grenade hollow, as an invective, and hath thrown the Court
into hysterics, as I hear from very good authority. Have you heard
from * * *?</p>

<p>"No more rhyme for&mdash;or rather, <i>from</i>&mdash;me. I have taken my leave of
that stage, and henceforth will mountebank it no longer. I have had
my day, and there's an end. The utmost I expect, or even wish, is
to have it said in the Biographia Britannica, that I might perhaps
have been a poet, had I gone on and amended. My great comfort is,
that the temporary celebrity I have wrung from the world has been
in the very teeth of all opinions and prejudices. I have flattered
no ruling powers; I have never concealed a single thought that
tempted me. They can't say I have truckled to the times, nor to
popular topics, (as Johnson, or somebody, said of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page62" name="page62"></a>Pg 62</span> Cleveland,) and
whatever I have gained has been at the expenditure of as much
<i>personal</i> favour as possible; for I do believe never was a bard
more unpopular, <i>quoad homo</i>, than myself. And now I have
done;&mdash;'ludite nunc alios.' Every body may be d&mdash;&mdash;d, as they seem
fond of it, and resolve to stickle lustily for endless brimstone.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;by the by, I had nearly forgot. There is a long poem, an
'Anti-Byron,' coming out, to prove that I have formed a conspiracy
to overthrow, by <i>rhyme</i>, all religion and government, and have
already made great progress! It is not very scurrilous, but serious
and ethereal. I never felt myself important, till I saw and heard
of my being such a little Voltaire as to induce such a production.
Murray would not publish it, for which he was a fool, and so I told
him; but some one else will, doubtless. 'Something too much of
this.'</p>

<p>"I have written an Ode on the fall of Napoleon, which, if you like,
I will copy out, and make you a present of. Mr. Merivale has seen
part of it, and likes it. You may show it to Mr. Gifford, and print

nothing in <i>his</i> favour, and no allusion whatever to our own
government or the Bourbons. Yours, &amp;c.</p>

Harold, which were much liked, beginning 'And thou art dead,' &amp;c.

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A resolution was, about this time, adopted by him, which, however
strange and precipitate it appeared, a knowledge of the previous state
of his mind may enable us to account for satisfactorily. He had now, for
two years, been drawing upon the admiration of the public with a
rapidity and success which seemed to defy exhaustion,&mdash;having crowded,
indeed, into that brief interval the materials of a long life of fame.
But admiration is a sort of impost from which most minds are but too
willing to relieve themselves. The eye grows weary of looking up to the
same object of wonder, and begins to exchange, at last, the delight of
observing its elevation for the less generous pleasure of watching and
speculating on its fall. The reputation of Lord Byron had already begun
to ex<span class="pagenum"><a id="page71" name="page71"></a>Pg 71</span>perience some of these consequences of its own prolonged and
constantly renewed splendour. Even among that host of admirers who would
have been the last to find fault, there were some not unwilling to
repose from praise; while they, who had been from the first reluctant
eulogists, took advantage of these apparent symptoms of satiety to
indulge in blame.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name="page72"></a>Pg 72</span>The loud outcry raised, at the beginning of the present year, by his
verses to the Princess Charlotte, had afforded a vent for much of this
reserved venom; and the tone of disparagement in which some of his
assailants now affected to speak of his poetry was, however absurd and
contemptible in itself, precisely that sort of attack which was the most
calculated to wound his, at once, proud and diffident spirit. As long as
they confined themselves to blackening his moral and social character,
so far from offending, their libels rather fell in with his own shadowy
style of self-portraiture, and gratified the strange inverted ambition
that possessed him. But the slighting opinion which they ventured to
express of his genius,&mdash;seconded as it was by that inward
dissatisfaction with his own powers, which they whose standard of
excellence is highest are always the surest to feel,&mdash;mortified and
disturbed him; and, being the first sounds of ill augury that had come
across his triumphal career, startled him, as we have seen, into serious
doubts of its continuance.</p>

<p>Had he been occupying himself, at the time, with any new task, that
confidence in his own energies, which he never truly felt but while in
the actual exercise of them, would have enabled him to forget these
humiliations of the moment in the glow and excitement of anticipated
success. But he had just pledged himself to the world to take a long
farewell of poesy,&mdash;had sealed up that only fountain from which his
heart ever drew refreshment or strength,&mdash;and thus was left, idly and
helplessly, to brood over the daily taunts of his enemies, without the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page73" name="page73"></a>Pg 73</span>
power of avenging himself when they insulted his person, and but too
much disposed to agree with them when they made light of his genius. "I
am afraid, (he says, in noticing these attacks in one of his letters,)
what you call <i>trash</i> is plaguily to the purpose, and very good sense
into the bargain; and, to tell the truth, for some little time past, I
have been myself much of the same opinion."</p>

<p>In this sensitive state of mind,&mdash;which he but ill disguised or relieved
by an exterior of gay defiance or philosophic contempt,&mdash;we can hardly
feel surprised that he should have, all at once, come to the resolution,
not only of persevering in his determination to write no more in future,
but of purchasing back the whole of his past copyrights, and suppressing
every page and line he had ever written. On his first mention of this
design, Mr. Murray naturally doubted as to its seriousness; but the
arrival of the following letter, enclosing a draft for the amount of the
copyrights, put his intentions beyond question.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 180. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"2. Albany, April 29. 1814.</p>

<p>"Dear Sir,</p>

<p>"I enclose a draft for the money; when paid, send the copyright. I
release you from the thousand pounds agreed on for The Giaour and
Bride, and there's an end.</p>

<p>"If any accident occurs to me, you may do then as you please; but,
with the exception of two copies of each for <i>yourself</i> only, I
expect and request that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page74" name="page74"></a>Pg 74</span> the advertisements be withdrawn, and the
remaining copies of <i>all</i> destroyed; and any expense so incurred I
will be glad to defray.</p>

<p>"For all this, it might be as well to assign some reason. I have
none to give, except my own caprice, and I do not consider the
circumstances of consequence enough to require explanation.</p>

<p>"In course, I need hardly assure you that they never shall be
published with my consent, directly, or indirectly, by any other
person whatsoever,&mdash;that I am perfectly satisfied, and have every
reason so to be, with your conduct in all transactions between us
as publisher and author.</p>

to consider you as my friend. Believe me very truly, and for much
attention,</p>

<p>"Your obliged and very obedient servant,</p>

<p>"If your present note is serious, and it really would be
inconvenient, there is an end of the matter; tear my draft, and go
on as usual: in that case, we will recur to our former basis. That
<i>I</i> was perfectly <i>serious</i>, in wishing to suppress all future
publication, is true; but certainly not to interfere with the
convenience of others, and more particularly your own. Some day, I
will tell you the reason of this apparently strange resolution. At
present, it may be enough to say that I recall it at your
suggestion; and as it appears to have annoyed you, I lose no time
in saying so.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>During my stay in town this year, we were almost daily together; and it
is in no spirit of flattery to the dead I say, that the more intimately
I became acquainted with his disposition and character, the more warmly
I felt disposed to take an interest in every thing that concerned him.
Not that, in the opportunities thus afforded me of observing more
closely his defects, I did not discover much to lament, and not a little
to condemn. But there was still, in the neighbourhood of even his worst
faults, some atoning good quality, which was always sure, if brought
kindly and with management into play, to neutralise their ill effects.
The very frankness, indeed, with which he avowed his errors seemed to
imply a confi<span class="pagenum"><a id="page76" name="page76"></a>Pg 76</span>dence in his own power of redeeming them,&mdash;a consciousness
that he could afford to be sincere. There was also, in such entire
unreserve, a pledge that nothing worse remained behind; and the same
quality that laid open the blemishes of his nature gave security for its
honesty. "The cleanness and purity of one's mind," says Pope, "is never
better proved than in discovering its own faults, at first view; as when
a stream shows the dirt at its bottom, it shows also the transparency of
the water."</p>

<p>The theatre was, at this time, his favourite place of resort. We have
seen how enthusiastically he expresses himself on the subject of Mr.
Kean's acting, and it was frequently my good fortune, during this
season, to share in his enjoyment of it,&mdash;the orchestra being, more than
once, the place where, for a nearer view of the actor's countenance, we
took our station. For Kean's benefit, on the 25th of May, a large party
had been made by Lady J * *, to which we both belonged; but Lord Byron
having also taken a box for the occasion, so anxious was he to enjoy the
representation uninterrupted, that, by rather an unsocial arrangement,
only himself and I occupied his box during the play, while every other
in the house was crowded almost to suffocation; nor did we join the
remainder of our friends till supper. Between the two parties, however,
Mr. Kean had no reason to complain of a want of homage to his talents;
as Lord J * *, on that occasion, presented him with a hundred pound
share in the theatre; while Lord Byron sent him, next day,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page77" name="page77"></a>Pg 77</span> the sum of
fifty guineas<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>; and, not long after, on seeing him act some of his
favourite parts, made him presents of a handsome snuff-box and a costly
Turkish sword.</p>

<p>Such effect had the passionate energy of Kean's acting on his mind,
that, once, in seeing him play Sir Giles Overreach, he was so affected
as to be seized with a sort of convulsive fit; and we shall find him,
some years after, in Italy, when the representation of Alfieri's tragedy
of Mirra had agitated him in the same violent manner, comparing the two
instances as the only ones in his life when "any thing under reality"
had been able to move him so powerfully.</p>

<p>The following are a few of the notes which I received from him during
this visit to town.</p>

<p>The supper, to which he here looks forward, took place at Watier's, of
which club he had lately become a member; and, as it may convey some
idea of his irregular mode of diet, and thus account, in part, for the
frequent derangement of his health, I shall here attempt, from
recollection, a description of his supper on this occasion. We were to
have been joined by Lord R * *, who however did not arrive, and the
party accordingly consisted but of ourselves. Having<span class="pagenum"><a id="page83" name="page83"></a>Pg 83</span> taken upon me to
order the repast, and knowing that Lord Byron, for the last two days,
had done nothing towards sustenance, beyond eating a few biscuits and
(to appease appetite) chewing mastic, I desired that we should have a
good supply of, at least, two kinds of fish. My companion, however,
confined himself to lobsters, and of these finished two or three, to his
own share,&mdash;interposing, sometimes, a small liqueur-glass of strong
white brandy, sometimes a tumbler of very hot water, and then pure
brandy again, to the amount of near half a dozen small glasses of the
latter, without which, alternately with the hot water, he appeared to
think the lobster could not be digested. After this, we had claret, of
which having despatched two bottles between us, at about four o'clock in
the morning we parted.</p>

<p>As Pope has thought his "delicious lobster-nights" worth commemorating,
these particulars of one in which Lord Byron was concerned may also have
some interest.</p>

<p>Among other nights of the same description which I had the happiness of
passing with him, I remember once, in returning home from some assembly
at rather a late hour, we saw lights in the windows of his old haunt
Stevens's, in Bond Street, and agreed to stop there and sup. On
entering, we found an old friend of his, Sir G * * W* *, who joined our
party, and the lobsters and brandy and water being put in requisition,
it was (as usual on such occasions) broad daylight before we separated.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>Pg 84</span></p>

<p>"In the year 1814, as Moore and I were going to dine with Lord Grey in
Portman Square, I pulled out a 'Java Gazette' (which Murray had sent to
me), in which there was a controversy on our respective merits as poets.
It was amusing enough that we should be proceeding peaceably to the same

the paper was dated six months before), and filling columns with

<p>"As I shall probably not see you here to-day, I write to request
that, if not inconvenient to yourself, you will stay in town till
<i>Sunday</i>; if not to gratify me, yet to please a great many others,
who will be very sorry to lose you. As for myself, I can only
repeat that I wish you would either remain a long time with us, or
not come at all; for these <i>snatches</i> of society make the
subsequent separations bitterer than ever.</p>

<p>"I believe you think that I have not been quite fair with that
Alpha and Omega of beauty, &amp;c. with whom you would willingly have
united me. But if you consider what her sister said on the subject,
you will less wonder that my pride should have taken the alarm;
particularly as nothing but the every-day flirtation of every-day
people ever occurred between your heroine and myself. Had Lady * *
appeared to wish it&mdash;or even not to oppose it&mdash;I would have gone
on, and very possibly married (that is, <i>if</i> the other had been
equally accordant) with the same indifference which has frozen over
the 'Black Sea'<span class="pagenum"><a id="page87" name="page87"></a>Pg 87</span> of almost all my passions. It is that very
indifference which makes me so uncertain and apparently capricious.
It is not eagerness of new pursuits, but that nothing impresses me
sufficiently to <i>fix</i>; neither do I feel disgusted, but simply
indifferent to almost all excitements. The proof of this is, that
obstacles, the slightest even, <i>stop</i> me. This can hardly be
<i>timidity</i>, for I have done some impudent things too, in my time;
and in almost all cases, opposition is a stimulus. In mine, it is
not; if a straw were in my way, I could not stoop to pick it up.</p>

<p>"I have sent this long tirade, because I would not have you suppose
that I have been <i>trifling</i> designedly with you or others. If you
think so, in the name of St. Hubert (the patron of antlers and
hunters) let me be married out of hand&mdash;I don't care to whom, so it

<p>On my return to London, for a short time, at the beginning of July, I
found his poem of 'Lara,' which he had begun at the latter end of May,
in the hands of the printer, and nearly ready for publication. He had,
before I left town, repeated to me, as we were on our way to some
evening party, the first one hundred and twenty lines of the poem, which
he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94"></a>Pg 94</span> had written the day before,&mdash;at the same time giving me a general
sketch of the characters and the story.</p>

the same impatient and whimsical character as those, of which I have
already given specimens, in my account of his preceding publications:
but, as matter of more interest now presses upon us, I shall forbear
from transcribing them at length. In one of them he says, "I have just
corrected some of the most horrible blunders that ever crept into a
proof:"&mdash;in another, "I hope the next proof will be better; this was one
which would have consoled Job, if it had been of his 'enemy's book:'"

<p>"I am sorry to say that the print<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> is by no means approved of by
those who have seen it, who are pretty conversant with the
original, as well as the picture from whence it is taken. I rather
suspect that it is from the <i>copy</i> and not the <i>exhibited</i>
portrait, and in this dilemma would recommend a suspension, if not
an abandonment, of the <i>prefixion</i> to the volumes which you purpose
inflicting upon the public.</p>

<p>"With regard to <i>Lara</i>, don't be in any hurry. I have not yet made
up my mind on the subject, nor know what to think or do till I hear
from you; and Mr. Moore appeared to me in a similar state of
indetermination. I do not know that it may not be better to
<i>reserve</i> it for the <i>entire</i> publication you proposed, and not
adventure in hardy singleness, or even backed by the fairy
Jacqueline. I have been seized with all kinds of doubts, &amp;c. &amp;c.

<p>"It is certainly a little extraordinary that you have not sent the
Edinburgh Review, as I requested, and hoped it would not require a
note a day to remind you. I see <i>advertisements</i> of Lara and
Jacqueline; pray, <i>why?</i> when I requested you to postpone

<p>"I have a most amusing epistle from the Ettrick bard&mdash;Hogg; in
which, speaking of his bookseller, whom he denominates the
'shabbiest' of the <i>trade</i> for not 'lifting his bills,' he adds, in
so many words, 'G&mdash;&mdash;d d&mdash;&mdash;n him and them both.' This is a pretty
prelude to asking you to adopt him (the said Hogg); but this he
wishes; and if you please, you and I will talk it over. He has a
poem ready for the press (and your <i>bills</i> too, if '<i>lift</i>able'),

Lara from the forthcoming Miscellany.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

surely he is a man of great powers, and deserving of encouragement.
I must knock out a Tale for him, and you should at all events
consider before you reject his suit. Scott is gone to the Orkneys
in a gale of wind; and Hogg says <span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>Pg 100</span>that, during the said gale, 'he
is sure that Scott is not quite at his ease, to say the best of
it.' Ah! I wish these home-keeping bards could taste a
Mediterranean white squall, or 'the Gut' in a gale of wind, or even
the 'Bay of Biscay' with no wind at all."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Hastings, August 3. 1814.</p>

<p>"By the time this reaches your dwelling, I shall (God wot) be in
town again probably. I have been here renewing my acquaintance with
my old friend Ocean; and I find his bosom as pleasant a pillow for
an hour in the morning as his daughters of Paphos could be in the
twilight. I have been swimming and eating turbot, and smuggling
neat brandies and silk handkerchiefs,&mdash;and listening to my friend
Hodgson's raptures about a pretty wife-elect of his,&mdash;and walking
on cliffs, and tumbling down hills, and making the most of the
'dolce far-niente' for the last fortnight. I met a son of Lord
Erskine's, who says he has been married a year, and is the
'happiest of men;' and I have met the aforesaid H., who is also the
'happiest of men;' so, it is worth while being here, if only to
witness the superlative felicity of these foxes, who have cut off
their tails, and would persuade the rest to part with their brushes
to keep them in countenance.</p>

<p>"It rejoiceth me that you like 'Lara.' Jeffrey is out with his 45th
Number, which I suppose you have got. He is only too kind to me, in
my share of it, and I begin to fancy myself a golden pheasant, upon
the strength of the plumage wherewith he hath<span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>Pg 101</span> bedecked me. But
then, 'surgit amari,' &amp;c.&mdash;the gentlemen of the Champion, and
Perry, have got hold (I know not how) of the condolatory address to
Lady J. on the picture-abduction by our R * * *, and have published
them&mdash;with my name, too, smack&mdash;without even asking leave, or
enquiring whether or no! D&mdash;&mdash;n their impudence, and d&mdash;&mdash;n every
thing. It has put me out of patience, and so, I shall say no more
about it.</p>

<p>"You shall have Lara and Jacque (both with some additions) when
out; but I am still demurring and delaying, and in a fuss, and so
is R. in his way.</p>

<p>"Newstead is to be mine again. Claughton forfeits twenty-five
thousand pounds; but that don't prevent me from being very prettily
ruined. I mean to bury myself there&mdash;and let my beard grow&mdash;and
hate you all.</p>

<p>"Oh! I have had the most amusing letter from Hogg, the Ettrick
minstrel and shepherd. He wants me to recommend him to Murray; and,
speaking of his present bookseller, whose 'bills' are never
'lifted,' he adds, <i>totidem verbis</i>, 'God d&mdash;&mdash;n him and them
both.' I laughed, and so would you too, at the way in which this
execration is introduced. The said Hogg is a strange being, but of
great, though uncouth, powers. I think very highly of him, as a
poet; but he, and half of these Scotch and Lake troubadours, are
spoilt by living in little circles and petty societies. London and
the world is the only place to take the conceit out of a man&mdash;in
the milling phrase. Scott, he says, is gone to the Orkneys<span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>Pg 102</span> in a
gale of wind;&mdash;during which wind, he affirms, the said Scott, 'he
is sure, is not at his ease,&mdash;to say the best of it.' Lord, Lord,
if these homekeeping minstrels had crossed your Atlantic or my
Mediterranean, and tasted a little open boating in a white
squall&mdash;or a gale in 'the Gut'&mdash;or the 'Bay of Biscay,' with no
gale at all&mdash;how it would enliven and introduce them to a few of
the sensations!&mdash;to say nothing of an illicit amour or two upon
shore, in the way of essay upon the Passions, beginning with simple
adultery, and compounding it as they went along.</p>

<p>"I have forwarded your letter to Murray,&mdash;by the way, you had
addressed it to Miller. Pray write to me, and say what art thou
doing? 'Not finished!'&mdash;Oons! how is this?&mdash;these 'flaws and
starts' must be 'authorised by your grandam,' and are unbecoming of
any other author. I was sorry to hear of your discrepancy with the
* *s, or rather your abjuration of agreement. I don't want to be
impertinent, or buffoon on a serious subject, and am therefore at a
loss what to say.</p>

<p>"I hope nothing will induce you to abate from the proper price of
your poem, as long as there is a prospect of getting it. For my own
part, I have <i>seriously</i> and <i>not whiningly</i>, (for that is not my
way&mdash;at least, it used not to be,) neither hopes, nor prospects,
and scarcely even wishes. I am, in some respects, happy, but not in
a manner that can or ought to last,&mdash;but enough of that. The worst
of it is, I feel quite enervated and indifferent. I really do not
know, if Jupiter were to offer me my choice<span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>Pg 103</span> of the contents of his
benevolent cask, what I would pick out of it. If I was born, as the
nurses say, with a 'silver spoon in my mouth,' it has stuck in my
throat, and spoiled my palate, so that nothing put into it is
swallowed with much relish,&mdash;unless it be cayenne. However, I have
grievances enough to occupy me that way too;&mdash;but for fear of
adding to yours by this pestilent long diatribe, I postpone the
reading of them, <i>sine die</i>.</p>

<p>"The Edinburgh Review is arrived&mdash;thanks. I enclose Mr. Hobhouse's
letter, from which you will perceive the work you have made.
However, I have done: you must send my rhymes to the devil your own
way. It seems, also, that the 'faithful and spirited likeness' is
another of your publications. I wish you joy of it; but it is no
likeness&mdash;that is the point. Seriously, if I have delayed your
journey to Scotland, I am sorry that you carried your complaisance
so far; particularly as upon trifles you have a more summary
method;&mdash;witness the grammar of Hobhouse's 'bit of prose,' which
has put him and me into a fever.</p>

<p>"I was <i>not</i> alone, nor will be while I can help it. Newstead is
not yet decided. Claughton is to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>Pg 105</span> a grand effort by Saturday
week to complete,&mdash;if not, he must give up twenty-five thousand
pounds and the estate, with expenses, &amp;c. &amp;c. If I resume the
Abbacy, you shall have due notice, and a cell set apart for your
reception, with a pious welcome. Rogers I have not seen, but Larry
and Jacky came out a few days ago. Of their effect I know nothing.</p>

<p>"There is something very amusing in <i>your</i> being an Edinburgh
Reviewer. You know, I suppose, that T * * is none of the placidest,
and may possibly enact some tragedy on being told that he is only a
fool. If, now, Jeffery were to be slain on account of an article of
yours, there would be a fine conclusion. For my part, as Mrs.
Winifred Jenkins says, 'he has done the handsome thing by me,'
particularly in his last number; so, he is the best of men and the
ablest of critics, and I won't have him killed,&mdash;though I dare say
many wish he were, for being so good-humoured.</p>

<p>"Before I left Hastings I got in a passion with an ink bottle,
which I flung out of the window one night with a vengeance;&mdash;and
what then? Why, next morning I was horrified by seeing that it had
struck, and split upon, the petticoat of Euterpe's graven image in
the garden, and grimed her as if it were on purpose<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. Only think
of my distress,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>Pg 106</span>and the epigrams that might be engendered on the
Muse and her misadventure.</p>

<p>"I had an adventure almost as ridiculous, at some private
theatricals near Cambridge&mdash;though of a different
description&mdash;since I saw you last. I quarrelled with a man in the
dark for asking me who I was (insolently enough to be sure), and
followed him into the green-room (a <i>stable</i>) in a rage, amongst a
set of people I never saw before. He turned out to be a low
comedian, engaged to act with the amateurs, and to be a
civil-spoken man enough, when he found out that nothing very
pleasant was to be got by rudeness. But you would have been amused
with the row, and the dialogue, and the dress&mdash;or rather the
undress&mdash;of the party, where I had introduced myself in a devil of
a hurry, and the astonishment that ensued. I had gone out of the
theatre, for coolness, into the garden;&mdash;there I had tumbled over
some dogs, and, coming away from them in very ill humour,
encountered the man in a worse, which produced all this confusion.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and why don't you 'launch?'&mdash;Now is your time. The people
are tolerably tired with me, and not very much enamoured of * *,
who has just spawned a quarto of metaphysical blank verse, which is
nevertheless only a part of a poem.</p>

<p>"Murray talks of divorcing Larry and Jacky&mdash;a bad sign for the
authors, who, I suppose, will be divorced too, and throw the blame
upon one another. Seriously, I don't care a cigar about it, and I
don't see why Sam should.</p>

entreatment by the journals you mention.</p>

<p>"I still think Mr. Hogg and yourself might make out an alliance.
<i>Dodsley's</i> was, I believe, the last decent thing of the kind, and
<i>his</i> had great success in its day, and lasted several years; but
then he had the double advantage of editing and publishing. The
Spleen, and several of <i>Gray's</i> odes, much of <i>Shenstone</i>, and many
others of good repute, made their first appearance in his
collection. Now, with the support of Scott, Wordsworth, Southey,
&amp;c., I see little reason why you should not do as well; and, if
once fairly established, you would have assistance from the
youngsters, I dare say. Stratford Canning (whose 'Buonaparte' is
excellent), and many others, and Moore, and Hobhouse, and I, would
try a fall now and then (if permitted), and you might coax
Campbell, too, into it. By the by, <i>he</i> has an unpublished (though
printed) poem on a scene in Germany, (Bavaria, I think,) which I
saw last year, that is perfectly magnificent, and equal to himself.
I wonder he don't publish it.</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;do you recollect S * *, the engraver's, mad letter about not
engraving Phillips's picture of Lord <i>Foley</i>? (as he blundered it;)
well, I have traced it, I think. It seems, by the papers, a
preacher of Johanna Southcote's is named <i>Foley</i>; and I can no way
account for the said S * *'s confusion of words and ideas, but by
that of his head's running on Johanna and her apostles. It was a
mercy he did not say Lord <i>Tozer</i>. You know, of course, that S * *
is a believer in this new (old) virgin of spiritual impregnation.</p>

it, a greater.</p>

game: if you remain, let me know.</p>

<p>"P.S. A word or two of 'Lara,' which your enclosure brings before
me. It is of no great promise separately; but, as connected with
the other tales, it will do very well for the volumes you mean to
publish. I would recommend this arrangement&mdash;Childe Harold, the
smaller Poems, Giaour, Bride, Corsair, Lara; the last completes the
series, and its very likeness renders it necessary to the others.

<p>"Now for a little egotism. My affairs stand thus. To-morrow, I
shall know whether a circumstance of importance enough to change
many of my plans will occur or not. If it does not, I am off for
Italy next month, and London, in the mean time, next week. I have
got back Newstead and twenty-five thousand pounds (out of
twenty-eight paid already),&mdash;as a 'sacrifice,' the late purchaser
calls it, and he may choose his own name. I have paid some of my
debts, and contracted others; but I have a few thousand pounds,
which I can't spend after my own heart in this climate, and so, I
shall go back to the south. Hobhouse, I think and hope, will go
with me; but,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>Pg 113</span> whether he will or not, I shall. I want to see
Venice, and the Alps, and Parmesan cheeses, and look at the coast
of Greece, or rather Epirus, from Italy, as I once did&mdash;or fancied
I did&mdash;that of Italy, when off Corfu. All this, however, depends
upon an event, which may, or may not, happen. Whether it will, I
shall know probably to-morrow, and, if it does, I can't well go
abroad at present.</p>

again soon;&mdash;I don't call this an answer. Ever most
affectionately," &amp;c.</p>

<p>The "circumstance of importance," to which he alludes in this
letter, was his second proposal for Miss Milbanke, of which he was
now waiting the result. His own account, in his Memoranda, of the
circumstances that led to this step is, in substance, as far as I
can trust my recollection, as follows. A person, who had for some
time stood high in his affection and confidence, observing how
cheerless and unsettled was the state both of his mind and
prospects, advised him strenuously to marry; and, after much
discussion, he consented. The next point for consideration was&mdash;who
was to be the object of his choice; and while his friend mentioned
one lady, he himself named Miss Milbanke. To this, however, his
adviser strongly objected,&mdash;remarking to him, that Miss Milbanke
had at present no fortune, and that his embarrassed affairs would
not allow him to marry without one; that she was, moreover, a
learned lady, which would not at all suit him. In consequence of
these representations, he agreed that his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>Pg 114</span> friend should write a
proposal for him to the other lady named, which was accordingly
done;&mdash;and an answer, containing a refusal, arrived as they were,
one morning, sitting together. "You see," said Lord Byron, "that,
after all, Miss Milbanke is to be the person;&mdash;I will write to
her." He accordingly wrote on the moment, and, as soon as he had
finished, his friend, remonstrating still strongly against his
choice, took up the letter,&mdash;but, on reading it over, observed,
"Well, really, this is a very pretty letter;&mdash;it is a pity it
should not go. I never read a prettier one."&mdash;"Then it <i>shall</i> go,"
said Lord Byron; and in so saying, sealed and sent off, on the
instant, this fiat of his fate.</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER 202. TO THE COUNTESS OF * * *.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Albany, October 5. 1814.</p>

<p>"Dear Lady * *,</p>

<p>"Your recollection and invitation do me great honour; but I am
going to be 'married, and can't come.' My intended is two hundred
miles off, and the moment my business here is arranged, I must set
out in a great hurry to be happy. Miss Milbanke is the good-natured
person who has undertaken me, and, of course, I am very much in
love, and as silly as all single gentlemen must be in that
sentimental situation. I have been accepted these three weeks; but
when the event will take place, I don't exactly know. It depends
partly upon lawyers, who are never in a hurry. One can be sure of
nothing; but, at present, there appears no other interruption to
this intention, which seems as mutual as possible, and now no
secret, though I did not tell first,&mdash;and all our relatives are
congratulating away to right and left in the most fatiguing manner.</p>

<p>"You perhaps know the lady. She is niece to Lady Melbourne, and
cousin to Lady Cowper and others of your acquaintance, and has no
fault, except<span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>Pg 118</span> being a great deal too good for me, and that <i>I</i>
must pardon, if nobody else should. It might have been <i>two</i> years
ago, and, if it had, would have saved me a world of trouble. She
has employed the interval in refusing about half a dozen of my
particular friends, (as she did me once, by the way,) and has taken
me at last, for which I am very much obliged to her. I wish it was
well over, for I do hate bustle, and there is no marrying without
some;&mdash;and then, I must not marry in a black coat, they tell me,
and I can't bear a blue one.</p>

<p>"Pray forgive me for scribbling all this nonsense. You know I must
be serious all the rest of my life, and this is a parting piece of
buffoonery, which I write with tears in my eyes, expecting to be
agitated. Believe me most seriously and sincerely your obliged
servant, BYRON.</p>

why I should suspect Claughton of such a thing, and yet I partly
do, because it might interrupt his renewal of purchase, if so
disposed; in short it matters not, but we are all in the road to

very glad of it. All her relatives, and all mine too, seem equally
pleased.</p>

County Journal, and this in the teeth of it would appear to him and
his as <i>my</i> denial. But I have written to do away that, enclosing
Perry's letter, which was very polite and kind.</p>

<p>"Nobody hates bustle so much as I do; but there seems a fatality
over every scene of my drama, always a row of some sort or other.
No matter&mdash;Fortune is my best friend; and as I acknowledge my
obligations to her, I hope she will treat me better than she
treated the Athenian, who took some merit to <i>himself</i> on some

wept melodiously, except 'at the request of friends.'</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"October 14. 1814.</p>

<p>"An' there were any thing in marriage that would make a difference
between my friends and me, particularly in your case, I would 'none
on't.' My agent sets off for Durham next week, and I shall follow
him, taking Newstead and you in my way. I certainly did not address
Miss Milbanke with these views, but it is likely she may prove a
considerable <i>parti</i>. All her father can give, or leave<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>Pg 121</span> her, he
will; and from her childless uncle, Lord Wentworth, whose barony,
it is supposed, will devolve on Ly. Milbanke (her sister), she has
expectations. But these will depend upon his own disposition, which
seems very partial towards her. She is an only child, and Sir R.'s
estates, though dipped by electioneering, are considerable. Part of
them are settled on her; but whether <i>that</i> will be <i>dowered</i> now,
I do not know,&mdash;though, from what has been intimated to me, it
probably will. The lawyers are to settle this among them, and I am
getting my property into matrimonial array, and myself ready for
the journey to Seaham, which I must make in a week or ten days.</p>

<p>"I certainly did not dream that she was attached to me, which it

I won't trouble you with it. As to her virtues, &amp;c. &amp;c. you will

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Soon after the date of this letter, Lord Byron had to pay a visit to
Cambridge for the purpose of voting<span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>Pg 124</span> for Mr. Clarke, who had been
started by Trinity College as one of the candidates for Sir Busick
Harwood's Professorship. On this occasion, a circumstance occurred which
could not but be gratifying to him. As he was delivering in his vote to
the Vice-Chancellor, in the Senate House, the under-graduates in the
gallery ventured to testify their admiration of him by a general murmur
of applause and stamping of the feet. For this breach of order, the
gallery was immediately cleared by order of the Vice-Chancellor.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the month of December, being called up to town by
business, I had opportunities, from being a good deal in my noble
friend's society, of observing the state of his mind and feelings, under
the prospect of the important change he was now about to undergo; and it
was with pain I found that those sanguine hopes<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> with which I had
sometimes looked forward to the happy influence of marriage, in winning
him over to the brighter and better side of life, were, by a view of all
the circumstances of his present destiny, considerably diminished;
while, at the same time, not a few doubts and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>Pg 125</span> misgivings, which had
never before so strongly occurred to me, with regard to his own fitness,
under any circumstances, for the matrimonial tie, filled me altogether
with a degree of foreboding anxiety as to his fate, which the
unfortunate events that followed but too fully justified.</p>

<p>The truth is, I fear, that rarely, if ever, have men of the higher order
of genius shown themselves fitted for the calm affections and comforts
that form the cement of domestic life. "One misfortune (says Pope) of
extraordinary geniuses is, that their very friends are more apt to
admire than love them." To this remark there have, no doubt, been
exceptions,&mdash;and I should pronounce Lord Byron, from my own experience,
to be one of them,&mdash;but it would not be difficult, perhaps, to show,
from the very nature and pursuits of genius, that such must generally be
the lot of all pre-eminently gifted with it; and that the same qualities
which enable them to command admiration are also those that too often
incapacitate them from conciliating love.</p>

<p>The very habits, indeed, of abstraction and self-study to which the
occupations of men of genius lead, are, in themselves, necessarily, of
an unsocial and detaching tendency, and require a large portion of
indulgence from others not to be set down as unamiable. One of the chief
sources, too, of sympathy and society between ordinary mortals being
their dependence on each other's intellectual resources, the operation
of this social principle must naturally be weakest in those whose own
mental stores are most abundant and self-sufficing, and who,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>Pg 126</span> rich in
such materials for thinking within themselves, are rendered so far
independent of any aid from others. It was this solitary luxury (which
Plato called "banqueting his own thoughts") that led Pope, as well as
Lord Byron, to prefer the silence and seclusion of his library to the
most agreeable conversation.&mdash;And not only too, is the necessity of
commerce with other minds less felt by such persons, but, from that
fastidiousness which the opulence of their own resources generates, the
society of those less gifted than themselves becomes often a restraint
and burden, to which not all the charms of friendship, or even love, can
reconcile them. "Nothing is so tiresome (says the poet of Vaucluse, in
assigning a reason for not living with some of his dearest friends) as
to converse with persons who have not the same information as one's
self."</p>

<p>But it is the cultivation and exercise of the imaginative faculty that,
more than any thing, tends to wean the man of genius from actual life,
and, by substituting the sensibilities of the imagination for those of
the heart, to render, at last, the medium through which he feels no less
unreal than that through which he thinks. Those images of ideal good and
beauty that surround him in his musings soon accustom him to consider
all that is beneath this high standard unworthy of his care; till, at
length, the heart becoming chilled as the fancy warms, it too often
happens that, in proportion as he has refined and elevated his theory of
all the social affections, he has unfitted himself for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>Pg 127</span> practice of
them.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Hence so frequently it arises that, in persons of this
temperament, we see some bright but artificial idol of the brain usurp
the place of all real and natural objects of tenderness. The poet Dante,
a wanderer away from wife and children, passed the whole of a restless
and detached life in nursing his immortal dream of Beatrice; while
Petrarch, who would not suffer his only daughter to reside beneath his
roof, expended thirty-two years of poetry and passion on an idealised
love.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, in the very nature and essence of genius to be for ever
occupied intensely with Self, as the great centre and source of its
strength. Like the sister Rachel, in Dante, sitting all day before her
mirror,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"mai non si smaga<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Del suo ammiraglio, e siede tutto giorno."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To this power of self-concentration, by which alone all the other powers
of genius are made available, there is, of course, no such disturbing
and fatal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>Pg 128</span>enemy as those sympathies and affections that draw the mind
out actively towards others<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>; and, accordingly, it will be found
that, among those who have felt within themselves a call to immortality,
the greater number have, by a sort of instinct, kept aloof from such
ties, and, instead of the softer duties and rewards of being amiable,
reserved themselves for the high, hazardous chances of being great. In
looking back through the lives of the most illustrious poets,&mdash;the class
of intellect in which the characteristic features of genius are,
perhaps, most strongly marked,&mdash;we shall find that, with scarcely one
exception, from Homer down to Lord Byron, they have been, in their
several degrees, restless and solitary spirits, with minds wrapped up,
like silk-worms, in their own tasks, either strangers, or rebels to
domestic ties, and bearing about with them a deposit for posterity in
their souls, to the jealous watching and enriching of which almost all
other thoughts and considerations have been sacrificed.</p>

<p>"To follow poetry as one ought (says the authority<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> I have already
quoted), one must forget father and mother and cleave to it alone." In
these few words is pointed out the sole path that leads genius to
greatness. On such terms alone are the high <span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>Pg 129</span>places of fame to be
won;&mdash;nothing less than the sacrifice of the entire man can achieve
them. However delightful, therefore, may be the spectacle of a man of
genius tamed and domesticated in society, taking docilely upon him the
yoke of the social ties, and enlightening without disturbing the sphere
in which he moves, we must nevertheless, in the midst of our admiration,
bear in mind that it is not thus smoothly or amiably immortality has
been ever struggled for, or won. The poet thus circumstanced may be
popular, may be loved; for the happiness of himself and those linked
with him he is in the right road,&mdash;but not for greatness. The marks by
which Fame has always separated her great martyrs from the rest of
mankind are not upon him, and the crown cannot be his. He may dazzle,
may captivate the circle, and even the times in which he lives, but he
is not for hereafter.</p>

<p>To the general description here given of that high class of human
intelligences to which he belonged, the character of Lord Byron was, in
many respects, a signal exception. Born with strong affections and
ardent passions, the world had, from first to last, too firm a hold on
his sympathies to let imagination altogether usurp the place of reality,
either in his feelings, or in the objects of them. His life, indeed, was
one continued struggle between that instinct of genius, which was for
ever drawing him back into the lonely laboratory of Self, and those
impulses of passion, ambition, and vanity, which again hurried him off
into the crowd, and entangled him in its interests; and though it may be
granted that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>Pg 130</span> would have been more purely and abstractedly the
<i>poet</i>, had he been less thoroughly, in all his pursuits and
propensities, the <i>man</i>, yet from this very mixture and alloy has it
arisen that his pages bear so deeply the stamp of real life, and that in
the works of no poet, with the exception of Shakspeare, can every
various mood of the mind&mdash;whether solemn or gay, whether inclined to the
ludicrous or the sublime, whether seeking to divert itself with the
follies of society or panting after the grandeur of solitary
nature&mdash;find so readily a strain of sentiment in accordance with its
every passing tone.</p>

<p>But while the naturally warm cast of his affections and temperament gave
thus a substance and truth to his social feelings which those of too
many of his fellow votaries of Genius have wanted, it was not to be
expected that an imagination of such range and power should have been so
early developed and unrestrainedly indulged without producing, at last,
some of those effects upon the heart which have invariably been found
attendant on such a predominance of this faculty. It must have been
observed, indeed, that the period when his natural affections flourished
most healthily was before he had yet arrived at the full consciousness
of his genius,&mdash;before Imagination had yet accustomed him to those
glowing pictures, after gazing upon which all else appeared cold and
colourless. From the moment of this initiation into the wonders of his
own mind, a distaste for the realities of life began to grow upon him.
Not even that intense craving after affection, which nature had
implanted in him, could keep his ardour still alive in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>Pg 131</span> a pursuit whose
results fell so short of his "imaginings;" and though, from time to
time, the combined warmth of his fancy and temperament was able to call
up a feeling which to his eyes wore the semblance of love, it may be
questioned whether his heart had ever much share in such passions, or
whether, after his first launch into the boundless sea of imagination,
he could ever have been brought back and fixed by any lasting
attachment. Actual objects there were, in but too great number, who, as
long as the illusion continued, kindled up his thoughts and were the
themes of his song. But they were, after all, little more than mere
dreams of the hour;&mdash;the qualities with which he invested them were
almost all ideal, nor could have stood the test of a month's, or even
week's, cohabitation. It was but the reflection of his own bright
conceptions that he saw in each new object; and while persuading himself
that they furnished the models of his heroines, he was, on the contrary,
but fancying that he beheld his heroines in them.</p>

<p>There needs no stronger proof of the predominance of imagination in
these attachments than his own serious avowal, in the Journal already
given, that often, when in the company of the woman he most loved, he
found himself secretly wishing for the solitude of his own study. It was
<i>there</i>, indeed,&mdash;in the silence and abstraction of that study,&mdash;that
the chief scene of his mistress's empire and glory lay. It was there
that, unchecked by reality, and without any fear of the disenchantments
of truth, he could view her through the medium of his own fer<span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>Pg 132</span>vid fancy,
enamour himself of an idol of his own creating, and out of a brief
delirium of a few days or weeks, send forth a dream of beauty and
passion through all ages.</p>

<p>While such appears to have been the imaginative character of his loves,
(of all, except the one that lived unquenched through all,) his
friendships, though, of course, far less subject to the influence of
fancy, could not fail to exhibit also some features characteristic of
the peculiar mind in which they sprung. It was a usual saying of his
own, and will be found repeated in some of his letters, that he had "no
genius for friendship," and that whatever capacity he might once have
possessed for that sentiment had vanished with his youth. If in saying
thus he shaped his notions of friendship according to the romantic
standard of his boyhood, the fact must be admitted: but as far as the
assertion was meant to imply that he had become incapable of a warm,
manly, and lasting friendship, such a charge against himself was unjust,
and I am not the only living testimony of its injustice.</p>

<p>To a certain degree, however, even in his friendships, the effects of a
too vivid imagination, in disqualifying the mind for the cold contact of
reality, were visible. We are told that Petrarch (who, in this respect,
as in most others, may be regarded as a genuine representative of the
poetic character,) abstained purposely from a too frequent intercourse
with his nearest friends, lest, from the sensitiveness he was so aware
of in himself, there should occur<span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133"></a>Pg 133</span> any thing that might chill his regard
for them<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>; and though Lord Byron was of a nature too full of social
and kindly impulses ever to think of such a precaution, it is a fact
confirmatory, at least, of the principle on which his brother poet,
Petrarch, acted, that the friends, whether of his youth or manhood, of
whom he had seen least, through life, were those of whom he always
thought and spoke with the most warmth and fondness. Being brought less
often to the touchstone of familiar intercourse, they stood naturally a
better chance of being adopted as the favourites of his imagination, and
of sharing, in consequence, a portion of that bright colouring reserved
for all that gave it interest and pleasure. Next to the dead, therefore,
whose hold upon his fancy had been placed beyond all risk of severance,
those friends whom he but saw occasionally, and by such favourable
glimpses as only renewed the first kindly impression they had made, were
the surest to live unchangingly, and without shadow, in his memory.</p>

<p>To this same cause, there is little doubt, his love for his sister owed
much of its devotedness and fervour. In a mind sensitive and versatile
as his, long habits of family intercourse might have estranged, or at
least dulled, his natural affection for her;&mdash;but their separation,
during youth, left this feeling <span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134"></a>Pg 134</span>fresh and untried.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> His very
inexperience in such ties made the smile of a sister no less a novelty
than a charm to him; and before the first gloss of this newly awakened
sentiment had time to wear off, they were again separated, and for ever.</p>

<p>If the portrait which I have here attempted of the general character of
those gifted with high genius be allowed to bear, in any of its
features, a resemblance to the originals, it can no longer, I think, be
matter of question whether a class so set apart from the track of
ordinary life, so removed, by their very elevation, out of the
influences of our common atmosphere, are at all likely to furnish
tractable subjects for that most trying of all social experiments,
matrimony. In reviewing the great names of philosophy and science, we
shall find that all who have most distinguished themselves in those
walks have, at least, virtually admitted their own unfitness for the
marriage tie by remaining in celibacy;&mdash;Newton, Gassendi, Galileo,
Descartes, Bayle, Locke, Leibnitz, Boyle, Hume, and a long list of other
illustrious sages, having all led single lives.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>Pg 135</span>The poetic race, it is true, from the greater susceptibility of their
imaginations, have more frequently fallen into the ever ready snare. But
the fate of the poets in matrimony has but justified the caution of the
philosophers. While the latter have given warning to genius by keeping
free of the yoke, the others have still more effectually done so by
their misery under it;&mdash;the annals of this sensitive race having, at all
times, abounded with proofs, that genius ranks but low among the
elements of social happiness,&mdash;that, in general, the brighter the gift,
the more disturbing its influence, and that in married life
particularly, its effects have been too often like that of the "Wormwood
Star," whose light filled the waters on which it fell with bitterness.</p>

<p>Besides the causes already enumerated as leading naturally to such a
result, from the peculiarities by which, in most instances, these great
labourers in the field of thought are characterised, there is also much,
no doubt, to be attributed to an unluckiness in the choice of
helpmates,&mdash;dictated, as that choice frequently must be, by an
imagination accustomed to deceive itself. But from whatever causes it
may have arisen, the coincidence is no less striking than saddening,
that, on the list of married poets who have been unhappy in their homes,
there should already be found four such illustrious names as Dante,
Milton<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>, Shaks<span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>Pg 136</span>peare<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, and Dryden; and that we should now have to
add, as a partner in their destiny, a name worthy of being placed beside
the greatest of them,&mdash;Lord Byron.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned my having been called up to town in the
December of this year. The opportunities I had of seeing Lord Byron
during my stay were frequent; and, among them, not the least memorable
or agreeable were those evenings we passed together at the house of his
banker, Mr. Douglas Kinnaird, where music,&mdash;followed by its accustomed
sequel of supper, brandy and water, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137"></a>Pg 137</span>not a little laughter,&mdash;kept us
together, usually, till rather a late hour. Besides those songs of mine
which he has himself somewhere recorded as his favourites, there was
also one to a Portuguese air, "The song of war shall echo through our
mountains," which seemed especially to please him;&mdash;the national
character of the music, and the recurrence of the words "sunny
mountains," bringing back freshly to his memory the impressions of all
he had seen in Portugal. I have, indeed, known few persons more alive to
the charms of simple music; and not unfrequently have seen the tears in
his eyes while listening to the Irish Melodies. Among those that thus
affected him was one beginning "When first I met thee warm and young,"
the words of which, besides the obvious feeling which they express, were
intended also to admit of a political application. He, however,
discarded the latter sense wholly from his mind, and gave himself up to
the more natural sentiment of the song with evident emotion.</p>

<p>On one or two of these evenings, his favourite actor, Mr. Kean, was of
the party; and on another occasion, we had at dinner his early
instructor in pugilism, Mr. Jackson, in conversing with whom, all his
boyish tastes seemed to revive;&mdash;and it was not a little amusing to
observe how perfectly familiar with the annals of "The Ring<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>," and
with all the most <span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138"></a>Pg 138</span>recondite phraseology of "the Fancy," was the sublime
poet of Childe Harold.</p>

<p>The following note is the only one, of those I received from him at this
time, worth transcribing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"December 14. 1814.</p>

<p>On his arrival in town, he had, upon enquiring into the state of his
affairs, found them in so utterly embarrassed a condition as to fill him
with some alarm, and even to suggest to his mind the prudence of
deferring his marriage. The die was, however, cast, and he had now no
alternative but to proceed. Accordingly, at the end of December,
accompanied by his friend Mr. Hobhouse, he set out for Seaham, the seat
of Sir Ralph Milbanke, the lady's father, in the county of Durham, and
on the 2d of January, 1815, was married.</p>

<p>This touching picture agrees so closely in many of its circumstances,
with his own prose account of the wedding in his Memoranda, that I feel
justified in introducing it, historically, here. In that Memoir, he
described himself as waking, on the morning of his marriage, with the
most melancholy reflections, on seeing his wedding-suit spread out
before him. In the same mood, he wandered about the grounds alone, till
he was summoned for the ceremony, and joined, for the first time on that
day, his bride and her family. He knelt down, he repeated the words<span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>Pg 141</span>
after the clergyman; but a mist was before his eyes,&mdash;his thoughts were
elsewhere; and he was but awakened by the congratulations of the
bystanders, to find that he was&mdash;married.</p>

<p>The same morning, the wedded pair left Seaham for Halnaby, another seat
of Sir Ralph Milbanke, in the same county. When about to depart, Lord
Byron said to the bride, "Miss Milbanke, are you ready?"&mdash;a mistake
which the lady's confidential attendant pronounced to be a "bad omen."</p>

<p>It is right to add, that I quote these slight details from memory, and
am alone answerable for any inaccuracy there may be found in them.</p>

<p>"Jeffrey has been so very kind about me and my damnable works, that
I would not be indirect or<span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>Pg 148</span> equivocal with him, even for a friend.
So, it may be as well to tell him that it is not mine; but that if
I did not firmly and truly believe it to be much better than I
could offer, I would never have troubled him or you about it. You
can judge between you how far it is admissible, and reject it, if
not of the right sort. For my own part, I have no interest in the

should the composition be a good one, it can hurt neither

inoculated with the same. Have you never found out that you have a
particular style of your own, which is as distinct from all other

And now if he don't drub the allies, there is 'no purchase in

don't repulse the invaders, when backed by those celebrated
sworders&mdash;those boys of the blade, the Imperial Guard, and the old
and new army. It is impossible not to be dazzled and overwhelmed by
his character and career. Nothing ever so disappointed me as his
abdication, and nothing could have reconciled me to him but some
such revival as his recent exploit; though no one could anticipate
such a complete and brilliant renovation.</p>

<p>"To your question, I can only answer that there have been some
symptoms which look a little gestatory. It is a subject upon which
I am not particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>Pg 157</span>ly anxious, except that I think it would please

how to wish him in heaven, if he can be comfortable on earth. Her

<p>"It will give me great pleasure to comply with your request, though
I hope there is still taste enough left amongst us to render it
almost unnecessary, sordid and interested as, it must be admitted,
many of 'the trade' are, where circumstances give them an

the temporary partiality of what is called 'the public' for the

of such impressions. You must have lived to see many of these pass
away, and will survive many more&mdash;I mean personally, for

<p>"If I may be permitted, I would suggest that there never was such
an opening for tragedy. In Kean, there is an actor worthy of
expressing the thoughts of the characters which you have every
power of embodying; and I cannot but regret that the part of
Ordonio was disposed of before his appearance at Drury Lane. We
have had nothing to be mentioned in the same breath with 'Remorse'
for very many years; and I should think that the reception of that
play was sufficient to encourage the highest hopes of author and
audience. It is to be hoped that you are proceeding in a career
which could not but be successful. With my best respects to Mr.

please to call it. I can only say, that it was written when I was
very young and very angry, and has been a thorn in my side ever
since; more particularly as almost all the persons animadverted
upon became subsequently my acquaintances, and some of them my
friends, which is 'heaping fire upon an enemy's head,' and
forgiving me too readily to permit me to forgive myself. The part
applied to you is pert, and petulant, and shallow enough; but,
although I have long done every thing in my power to suppress the
circulation of the whole thing, I shall always regret the
wantonness or generality of many of its attempted attacks."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was in the course of this spring that Lord Byron and Sir Walter Scott
became, for the first time, personally acquainted with each other. Mr.
Murray, having been previously on a visit to the latter gentleman, had
been intrusted by him with a superb Turkish dagger as a present to Lord
Byron; and the noble poet, on their meeting this year in London,&mdash;the
only time when these two great men had ever an opportunity of enjoying
each other's society,&mdash;presented to Sir Walter, in return, a vase
containing some human bones that had been dug up from under a part of
the old walls of Athens. The reader, however, will be much better
pleased to have these particulars in the words of Sir Walter Scott
himself, who, with that good-nature which renders him no less amiable
than he is admirable, has found time, in the midst of all his
marvellous<span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>Pg 160</span> labours for the world, to favour me with the following
interesting communication:<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"My first acquaintance with Byron began in a manner rather doubtful. I
was so far from having <span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>Pg 161</span>any thing to do with the offensive criticism in
the Edinburgh, that I remember remonstrating against it with our friend,
the editor, because I thought the 'Hours of Idleness' treated with undue
severity. They were written, like all juvenile poetry, rather from the
recollection of what had pleased the author in others than what had been
suggested by his own imagination; but, nevertheless, I thought they
contained some passages of noble promise. I was so much impressed with
this, that I had thoughts of writing to the author; but some exaggerated
reports concerning his peculiarities, and a natural unwillingness to
intrude an opinion which was uncalled for, induced me to relinquish the
idea.</p>

<p>"When Byron wrote his famous Satire, I had my share of flagellation
among my betters. My crime was having written a poem (Marmion, I think)
for a thousand pounds; which was no otherwise true than that I sold the
copy-right for that sum. Now, not to mention that an author can hardly
be censured for accepting such a sum as the booksellers are willing to
give him, especially as the gentlemen of the trade made no complaints of
their bargain, I thought the interference with my private affairs was
rather beyond the limits of literary satire. On the other hand, Lord
Byron paid me, in several passages, so much more praise than I deserved,
that I must have been more irritable than I have ever felt upon such
subjects, not to sit down contented, and think no more about the matter.</p>

<p>"I was very much struck, with all the rest of the world, at the vigour
and force of imagination dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>Pg 162</span>played in the first Cantos of Childe
Harold, and the other splendid productions which Lord Byron flung from
him to the public with a promptitude that savoured of profusion. My own
popularity, as a poet, was then on the wane, and I was unaffectedly
pleased to see an author of so much power and energy taking the field.
Mr. John Murray happened to be in Scotland that season, and as I
mentioned to him the pleasure I should have in making Lord Byron's
acquaintance, he had the kindness to mention my wish to his Lordship,
which led to some correspondence.</p>

<p>"It was in the spring of 1815 that, chancing to be in London, I had the
advantage of a personal introduction to Lord Byron. Report had prepared
me to meet a man of peculiar habits and a quick temper, and I had some
doubts whether we were likely to suit each other in society. I was most
agreeably disappointed in this respect. I found Lord Byron in the
highest degree courteous, and even kind. We met, for an hour or two
almost daily, in Mr. Murray's drawing-room, and found a great deal to
say to each other. We also met frequently in parties and evening
society, so that for about two months I had the advantage of a
considerable intimacy with this distinguished individual. Our sentiments
agreed a good deal, except upon the subjects of religion and politics,
upon neither of which I was inclined to believe that Lord Byron
entertained very fixed opinions. I remember saying to him, that I really
thought, that if he lived a few years he would alter his sentiments. He
answered, rather sharply, 'I suppose you are<span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>Pg 163</span> one of those who prophesy
I will turn Methodist.' I replied, 'No&mdash;I don't expect your conversion
to be of such an ordinary kind. I would rather look to see you retreat
upon the Catholic faith, and distinguish yourself by the austerity of
your penances. The species of religion to which you must, or may, one
day attach yourself must exercise a strong power on the imagination.' He
smiled gravely, and seemed to allow I might be right.</p>

<p>"On politics, he used sometimes to express a high strain of what is now
called Liberalism; but it appeared to me that the pleasure it afforded
him as a vehicle of displaying his wit and satire against individuals in
office was at the bottom of this habit of thinking, rather than any real
conviction of the political principles on which he talked. He was
certainly proud of his rank and ancient family, and, in that respect, as
much an aristocrat as was consistent with good sense and good breeding.
Some disgusts, how adopted I know not, seemed to me to have given this
peculiar and, as it appeared to me, contradictory cast of mind: but, at
heart, I would have termed Byron a patrician on principle.</p>

<p>"Lord Byron's reading did not seem to me to have been very extensive
either in poetry or history. Having the advantage of him in that
respect, and possessing a good competent share of such reading as is
little read, I was sometimes able to put under his eye objects which had
for him the interest of novelty. I remember particularly repeating to
him the fine poem of Hardyknute, an imitation of the old Scottish
Ballad, with which he was so much affected,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>Pg 164</span> that some one who was in
the same apartment asked me what I could possibly have been telling
Byron by which he was so much agitated.</p>

<p>I saw Byron, for the last time, in 1815, after I returned from France.
He dined, or lunched, with me at Long's in Bond Street. I never saw him
so full of gaiety and good-humour, to which the presence of Mr. Mathews,
the comedian, added not a little. Poor Terry was also present. After one
of the gayest parties I ever was present at, my fellow-traveller, Mr.
Scott, of Gala, and I set off for Scotland, and I never saw Lord Byron
again. Several letters passed between us&mdash;one perhaps every half year.
Like the old heroes in Homer, we exchanged gifts:&mdash;I gave Byron a
beautiful dagger mounted with gold, which had been the property of the
redoubted Elfi Bey. But I was to play the part of Diomed, in the Iliad,
for Byron sent me, some time after, a large sepulchral vase of silver.
It was full of dead men's bones, and had inscriptions on two sides of
the base. One ran thus:&mdash;'The bones contained in this urn were found in
certain ancient sepulchres within the land walls of Athens, in the month
of February, 1811.' The other face bears the lines of Juvenal:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Expende&mdash;quot libras in duce summo invenies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Mors sola fatetur quantula hominum corpuscula."<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Juv. x.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To these I have added a third inscription, in these words&mdash;'The gift of
Lord Byron to Walter Scott.'<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>Pg 165</span>There was a letter with this vase more
valuable to me than the gift itself, from the kindness with which the
donor expressed himself towards me. I left it naturally in the urn with
the bones,&mdash;but it is now missing. As the theft was not of a nature to
be practised by a mere domestic, I am compelled to suspect the
inhospitality of some individual of higher station,&mdash;most gratuitously
exercised certainly, since, after what I have here said, no one will
probably choose to boast of possessing this literary curiosity.</p>

<p>"We had a good deal of laughing, I remember, on what the public might be
supposed to think, or say, concerning the gloomy and ominous nature of
our mutual gifts.</p>

<p>"I think I can add little more to my recollections of Byron. He was
often melancholy,&mdash;almost gloomy. When I observed him in this humour, I
used either to wait till it went off of its own accord, or till some
natural and easy mode occurred of leading him into conversation, when
the shadows almost always left his countenance, like the mist rising
from a landscape. In conversation he was very animated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>Pg 166</span>"I met with him very frequently in society; our mutual acquaintances
doing me the honour to think that he liked to meet with me. Some very
agreeable parties I can recollect,&mdash;particularly one at Sir George
Beaumont's, where the amiable landlord had assembled some persons
distinguished for talent. Of these I need only mention the late Sir
Humphry Davy, whose talents for literature were as remarkable as his
empire over science. Mr. Richard Sharpe and Mr. Rogers were also
present.</p>

<p>"I think I also remarked in Byron's temper starts of suspicion, when he
seemed to pause and consider whether there had not been a secret, and
perhaps offensive, meaning in something casually said to him. In this
case, I also judged it best to let his mind, like a troubled spring,
work itself clear, which it did in a minute or two. I was considerably
older, you will recollect, than my noble friend, and had no reason to
fear his misconstruing my sentiments towards him, nor had I ever the
slightest reason to doubt that they were kindly returned on his part. If
I had occasion to be mortified by the display of genius which threw into
the shade such pretensions as I was then supposed to possess, I might
console myself that, in my own case, the materials of mental happiness
had been mingled in a greater proportion.</p>

<p>"I rummage my brains in vain for what often rushes into my head
unbidden,&mdash;little traits and sayings which recall his looks, manner,
tone, and gestures; and I have always continued to think that a crisis
of life was arrived in which a new career of fame<span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>Pg 167</span> was opened to him,
and that had he been permitted to start upon it, he would have
obliterated the memory of such parts of his life as friends would wish
to forget."</p>

<p><b>LETTER 220. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"April 23. 1815.</p>

<p>"Lord Wentworth died last week. The bulk of his property (from
seven to eight thousand per ann.) is entailed on Lady Milbanke and
Lady Byron. The first is gone to take possession in Leicestershire,
and attend the funeral, &amp;c. this day.</p>

<p>"I have mentioned the facts of the settlement of Lord W.'s
property, because the newspapers, with their usual accuracy, have
been making all kinds of blunders in their statement. His will is
just as expected&mdash;the principal part settled on Lady Milbanke (now
Noel) and Bell, and a separate estate left for sale to pay debts
(which are not great) and legacies to his natural son and daughter.</p>

<p>Mrs. * *'s tragedy was last night damned. They may bring it on
again, and probably will; but damned it was,&mdash;not a word of the
last act audible. I went (<i>malgr&eacute;</i> that I ought to have stayed at
home in sackcloth for unc., but I could not resist the <i>first</i>
night of any thing) to a private and quiet nook of my private box,
and witnessed the whole process. The first three acts, with
transient gushes of applause, oozed patiently but heavily on. I
must say it was badly acted, particularly by * *, who was groaned
upon in the third act,&mdash;something about 'horror&mdash;such a horror' was
the cause. Well, the fourth<span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>Pg 168</span> act became as muddy and turbid as need
be; but the fifth&mdash;what Garrick used to call (like a fool) the
<i>concoction</i> of a play&mdash;the fifth act stuck fast at the King's
prayer. You know he says, 'he never went to bed without saying
them, and did not like to omit them now.' But he was no sooner upon
his knees, than the audience got upon their legs&mdash;the damnable
pit&mdash;and roared, and groaned, and hissed, and whistled. Well, that
was choked a little; but the ruffian-scene&mdash;the penitent
peasantry&mdash;and killing the Bishop and Princes&mdash;oh, it was all over.
The curtain fell upon unheard actors, and the announcement
attempted by Kean for Monday was equally ineffectual. Mrs. Bartley
was so frightened, that, though the people were tolerably quiet,
the epilogue was quite inaudible to half the house. In short,&mdash;you
know all. I clapped till my hands were skinless, and so did Sir
James Mackintosh, who was with me in the box. All the world were in
the house, from the Jerseys, Greys, &amp;c. &amp;c. downwards. But it would
not do. It is, after all, not an <i>acting</i> play; good language, but
no power. * * * Women (saving Joanna Baillie) cannot write tragedy:
they have not seen enough nor felt enough of life for it. I think
Semiramis or Catherine II. might have written (could they have been
unqueened) a rare play.</p>

<p>"It is, however, a good warning not to risk or write tragedies. I
never had much bent that way; but if I had, this would have cured
me.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"13. Piccadilly Terrace, June 12. 1815.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to offer in behalf of my late silence, except the
most inveterate and ineffable laziness; but I am too supine to
invent a lie, or I <i>certainly</i> should, being ashamed of the truth.
K * *, I hope, has appeased your magnanimous indignation at his
blunders. I wished and wish you were in the Committee, with all my
heart.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> It seems so hopeless a business, that the company of a
friend <span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170"></a>Pg 170</span>would be quite consoling,&mdash;but more of this when we meet.
In the mean time, you are entreated to prevail upon Mrs. Esterre to
engage herself. I believe she has been written to, but your
influence, in person or proxy, would probably go further than our
proposals. What they are, I know not; all <i>my</i> new function
consists in listening to the despair of Cavendish Bradshaw, the
hopes of Kinnaird, the wishes of Lord Essex, the complaints of
Whitbread, and the calculations of Peter Moore,&mdash;all of which, and
whom, seem totally at variance. C. Bradshaw wants to light the
theatre with <i>gas</i>, which may, perhaps (if the vulgar be believed),
poison half the audience, and all the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>. Essex has
endeavoured to persuade K * * not to get drunk, the consequence of
which is, that he has never been sober since. Kinnaird, with equal
success, would have convinced Raymond, that he, the said Raymond,
had too much salary. Whitbread wants us to assess the pit another
sixpence,&mdash;a d&mdash;&mdash;d insidious proposition,&mdash;which will end in an
O.P. combustion. To crown all, R * *, the auctioneer, has the
impudence to be displeased, because he has no dividend. The villain
is a proprietor of shares, and a long lunged orator in the
meetings. I hear he has prophesied our incapacity,&mdash;'a foregone
conclu<span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>Pg 171</span>sion,' whereof I hope to give him signal proofs before we
are done.</p>

<p>"Will you give us an opera? No, I'll be sworn; but I wish you
would.</p>

<p>"To go on with the poetical world, Walter Scott has gone back to
Scotland. Murray, the bookseller, has been cruelly cudgelled of
misbegotten knaves, 'in Kendal green,' at Newington Butts, in his
way home from a purlieu dinner,&mdash;and robbed&mdash;would you believe
it?&mdash;of three or four bonds of forty pound a piece, and a seal-ring
of his grandfather's, worth a million! This is his version,&mdash;but
others opine that D'Israeli, with whom he dined, knocked him down
with his last publication, 'The Quarrels of Authors,' in a dispute
about copyright. Be that as it may, the newspapers have teemed with
his 'injuria form&aelig;,' and he has been embrocated, and invisible to
all but the apothecary ever since.</p>

<p>"Lady B. is better than three months advanced in her progress
towards maternity, and, we hope, likely to go well through with it.
We have been very little out this season, as I wish to keep her
quiet in her present situation. Her father and mother have changed
their names to Noel, in compliance with Lord Wentworth's will, and
in complaisance to the property bequeathed by him.</p>

<p>"I hear that you have been gloriously received by the Irish,&mdash;and
so you ought. But don't let them kill you with claret and kindness
at the national dinner in your honour, which, I hear and hope, is
in contemplation. If you will tell me the day, I'll get<span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>Pg 172</span> drunk
myself on this side of the water, and waft you an applauding hiccup
over the Channel.</p>

<p>"Of politics, we have nothing but the yell for war; and C * * h is
preparing his head for the pike, on which we shall see it carried
before he has done. The loan has made every body sulky. I hear
often from Paris, but in direct contradiction to the home
statements of our hirelings. Of domestic doings, there has been
nothing since Lady D * *. Not a divorce stirring,&mdash;but a good many
in embryo, in the shape of marriages.</p>

<p>"I enclose you an epistle received this morning from I know not

National Poem called 'Dermid.' The same cause which prevented my
writing to you operated against my wish to write to him an epistle
of thanks. If you see him, will you make all kinds of fine speeches
for me, and tell him that I am the laziest and most ungrateful of
mortals?</p>

<p>"A word more;&mdash;don't let Sir John Stevenson (as an evidence on
trials for copy-right, &amp;c.) talk about the price of your next poem,
or they will come upon you for the <i>property tax</i> for it. I am
serious, and have just heard a long story of the rascally tax-men
making Scott pay for his. So, take care. Three hundred is a devil

afterwards. I perceive Perry attributes his death to Drury Lane,&mdash;a

I by no means sit easy under this dispensation of the Morning

surely a great and very good man.</p>

<p>"Paris is taken for the second time. I presume it, for the future,
will have an anniversary capture. In the late battles, like all the
world, I have lost a connection,&mdash;poor Frederick Howard, the best
of his race. I had little intercourse, of late years, with his
family, but I never saw or heard but good of him. Hobhouse's
brother is killed. In short, the havoc has not left a family out of
its tender mercies.</p>

<p>"Every hope of a republic is over, and we must go on under the old

luck which Providence is pleased to lavish on Lord Castlereagh is
only a proof of the little value the gods set upon prosperity, when
they permit such * * * s as he and that drunken corporal, old
Blucher, to bully their betters. From this, however, Wellington
should be excepted. He is a man,&mdash;and the Scipio of our Hannibal.

an Opera. Kinnaird's blunder was partly mine. I wanted you of all
things in the Committee, and so did he. But we are now glad you
were wiser; for it is, I doubt, a bitter business.</p>

<p>"When shall we see you in England? Sir Ralph Noel (<i>late</i>

that one man can't inhabit two houses, has given his place in the

<p>"I think it would be advisable for you to see the acting managers
when convenient, as there must be points on which you will want to
confer; the objection I stated was merely on the part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>Pg 177</span>
performers, and is <i>general</i> and not <i>particular</i> to this instance.
I thought it as well to mention it at once&mdash;and some of the
rehearsals you will doubtless see, notwithstanding.</p>

<p>"Rae, I rather think, has his eye on Naritzin for himself. He is a
more popular performer than Bartley, and certainly the cast will be
stronger with him in it; besides, he is one of the managers, and
will feel doubly interested if he can act in both capacities. Mrs.
Bartley will be Petrowna;&mdash;as to the Empress, I know not what to
say or think. The truth is, we are not amply furnished with tragic
women; but make the best of those we have,&mdash;you can take your

setting aside other considerations, we are particularly anxious, as
being the first tragedy to be brought out since the old Committee.</p>

a speech of Ivan's, in the scene with Petrowna and the Empress,

<p>"You are, it seems, in England again, as I am to hear from every
body but yourself; and I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181"></a>Pg 181</span> you punctilious, because I did
not answer your last Irish letter. When did you leave the 'swate
country?' Never mind, I forgive you;&mdash;a strong proof of&mdash;I know not
what&mdash;to give the lie to&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'He never pardons who hath done the wrong.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"You have written to * *. You have also written to Perry, who
intimates hope of an Opera from you. Coleridge has promised a
Tragedy. Now, if you keep Perry's word, and Coleridge keeps his
own, Drury Lane will be set up; and, sooth to say, it is in
grievous want of such a lift. We began at speed, and are blown
already. When I say 'we,' I mean Kinnaird, who is the 'all in all
sufficient,' and can count, which none of the rest of the Committee
can.</p>

<p>"It is really very good fun, as far as the daily and nightly stir
of these strutters and fretters go; and, if the concern could be
brought to pay a shilling in the pound, would do much credit to the
management. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; has an accepted tragedy * * * * *, whose first
scene is in his sleep (I don't mean the author's). It was forwarded
to us as a prodigious favourite of Kean's; but the said Kean, upon
interrogation, denies his eulogy, and protests against his part.
How it will end, I know not.</p>

<p>"I say so much about the theatre, because there is nothing else
alive in London at this season. All the world are out of it, except
us, who remain to lie in,&mdash;in December, or perhaps earlier. Lady B.
is very ponderous and prosperous, apparently, and I wish it well
over.</p>

<p>"There is a play before me from a personage who<span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182"></a>Pg 182</span> signs himself
'Hibernicus.' The hero is Malachi, the Irishman and king; and the
villain and usurper, Turgesius, the Dane. The conclusion is fine.
Turgesius is chained by the leg (<i>vide</i> stage direction) to a
pillar on the stage; and King Malachi makes him a speech, not
unlike Lord Castlereagh's about the balance of power and the
lawfulness of legitimacy, which puts Turgesius into a frenzy&mdash;as
Castlereagh's would, if his audience was chained by the leg. He
draws a dagger and rushes at the orator; but, finding himself at
the end of his tether, he sticks it into his own carcass, and dies,
saying, he has fulfilled a prophecy.</p>

<p>"Now, this is <i>serious downright matter of fact</i>, and the gravest
part of a tragedy which is not intended for burlesque. I tell it
you for the honour of Ireland. The writer hopes it will be
represented:&mdash;but what is Hope? nothing but the paint on the face
of Existence; the least touch of Truth rubs it off, and then we see
what a hollow-cheeked harlot we have got hold of. I am not sure
that I have not said this last superfine reflection before. But
never mind;&mdash;it will do for the tragedy of Turgesius, to which I
can append it.</p>

<p>"Well, but how dost thou do? thou bard not of a thousand but three
thousand! I wish your friend, Sir John Piano-forte, had kept that
to himself, and not made it public at the trial of the song-seller
in Dublin. I tell you why: it is a liberal thing for Longman to do,
and honourable for you to obtain; but it will set all the 'hungry
and dinnerless, lank-jawed judges' upon the fortunate author. But
they<span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>Pg 183</span> be d&mdash;&mdash;d!&mdash;the 'Jeffrey and the Moore together are confident
against the world in ink!' By the way, if poor C * * e&mdash;who is a
man of wonderful talent, and in distress<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>, and about to publish
two vols. of Poesy and Biography, and who has been worse used by
the critics than ever we were&mdash;will you, if he comes out, promise
me to review him favourably in the E.R.? Praise him I think you
must, but you will also praise him <i>well</i>,&mdash;of all things the most
difficult. It will be the making of him.</p>

<p>"This must be a secret between you and me, as Jeffrey might not
like such a project;&mdash;nor, indeed, might C. himself like it. But I
do think he only wants a pioneer and a sparkle or two to explode
most gloriously. Ever yours most affectionately, B.</p>

<p>"P.S. This is a sad scribbler's letter; but the next shall be 'more
of this world.'"</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>As, after this letter, there occur but few allusions to his connection
with the Drury Lane Management, I shall here avail myself of the
opportunity to give some extracts from his "Detached Thoughts,"
containing recollections of his short acquaintance with the interior of
the theatre.</p>

<p>"When I belonged to the Drury Lane Committee, and was one of the
Sub-Committee of Management,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184"></a>Pg 184</span> the number of <i>plays</i> upon the shelves
were about <i>five</i> hundred. Conceiving that amongst these there must be
<i>some</i> of merit, in person and by proxy I caused an investigation. I do
not think that of those which I saw there was one which could be
conscientiously tolerated. There never were such things as most of them!
Mathurin was very kindly recommended to me by Walter Scott, to whom I
had recourse, firstly, in the hope that he would do something for us
himself; and, secondly, in my despair, that he would point out to us any
young (or old) writer of promise. Mathurin sent his Bertram and a letter
<i>without</i> his address, so that at first I could give him no answer. When
I at last hit upon his residence, I sent him a favourable answer and
something more substantial. His play succeeded; but I was at that time
absent from England.</p>

<p>"I tried Coleridge too; but he had nothing feasible in hand at the time.
Mr. Sotheby obligingly offered <i>all</i> his tragedies, and I pledged
myself, and notwithstanding many squabbles with my Committed Brethren,
did get 'Ivan' accepted, read, and the parts distributed. But, lo! in
the very heart of the matter, upon some <i>tepid</i>ness on the part of Kean,
or warmth on that of the author, Sotheby withdrew his play. Sir J.B.
Burgess did also present four tragedies and a farce, and I moved
green-room and Sub-Committee, but they would not.</p>

<p>"Then the scenes I had to go through!&mdash;the authors, and the authoresses,
and the milliners, and the wild Irishmen,&mdash;the people from Brighton,
from Blackwall; from Chatham, from Cheltenham, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>Pg 185</span> Dublin, from
Dundee,&mdash;who came in upon me! to all of whom it was proper to give a
civil answer, and a hearing, and a reading. Mrs. * * * *'s father, an
Irish dancing-master of sixty years, calling upon me to request to play
Archer, dressed in silk stockings on a frosty morning to show his legs
(which were certainly good and Irish for his age, and had been still
better,)&mdash;Miss Emma Somebody, with a play entitled 'The Bandit of
Bohemia,' or some such title or production,&mdash;Mr. O'Higgins, then
resident at Richmond, with an Irish tragedy, in which the unities could
not fail to be observed, for the protagonist was chained by the leg to a
pillar during the chief part of the performance. He was a wild man, of a
salvage appearance, and the difficulty of <i>not</i> laughing at him was only
to be got over by reflecting upon the probable consequences of such
cachinnation.</p>

<p>"As I am really a civil and polite person, and <i>do</i> hate giving pain
when it can be avoided, I sent them up to Douglas Kinnaird,&mdash;who is a
man of business, and sufficiently ready with a negative,&mdash;and left them
to settle with him; and as the beginning of next year I went abroad, I
have since been little aware of the progress of the theatres.</p>

<p>"Players are said to be an impracticable people. They are so; but I
managed to steer clear of any disputes with them, and excepting one
debate<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186"></a>Pg 186</span>the elder Byrne about Miss Smith's <i>pas
de</i>&mdash;(something&mdash;I forget the technicals,)&mdash;I do not remember any
litigation of my own. I used to protect Miss Smith, because she was like
Lady Jane Harley in the face, and likenesses go a great way with me.
Indeed, in general, I left such things to my more bustling colleagues,
who used to reprove me seriously for not being able to take such things
in hand without buffooning with the histrions, or throwing things into
confusion by treating light matters with levity.</p>

<p>"Then the Committee!&mdash;then the Sub-Committee!&mdash;we were but few, but
never agreed. There was Peter Moore who contradicted Kinnaird, and
Kinnaird who contradicted every body: then our two managers, Rae and
Dibdin; and our secretary, Ward! and yet we were all very zealous and
in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187"></a>Pg 187</span> earnest to do good and so forth. * * * * furnished us with prologues
to our revived old English plays; but was not pleased with me for
complimenting him as 'the Upton' of our theatre (Mr. Upton is or was the
poet who writes the songs for Astley's), and almost gave up prologuing
in consequence.</p>

<p>"In the pantomime of 1815-16 there was a representation of the
masquerade of 1814 given by 'us youth' of Watier's Club to Wellington
and Co. Douglas Kinnaird and one or two others, with myself, put on
masks, and went on the stage with the &#8001;&#953; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#953;, to see the
effect of a theatre from the stage:&mdash;it is very grand. Douglas danced
among the figuranti too, and they were puzzled to find out who we were,
as being more than their number. It was odd enough that Douglas Kinnaird
and I should have been both at the <i>real</i> masquerade, and afterwards in
the mimic one of the same, on the stage of Drury Lane theatre."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Terrace, Piccadilly, October 31. 1815.</p>

<p>"I have not been able to ascertain precisely the time of duration
of the stock market; but I believe it is a good time for selling
out, and I hope so. First, because I shall see you; and, next,
because I shall receive certain monies on behalf of Lady B., the
which will materially conduce to my comfort,&mdash;I wanting (as the
duns say) 'to make up a sum.'</p>

<p>"Yesterday, I dined out with a large-ish party, where were Sheridan
and Colman, Harry Harris of C. G, and his brother, Sir Gilbert
Heathcote, Ds.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188"></a>Pg 188</span> Kinnaird, and others, of note and notoriety. Like
other parties of the kind, it was first silent, then talky, then
argumentative, then disputatious, then unintelligible, then
altogethery, then inarticulate, and then drunk. When we had reached
the last step of this glorious ladder, it was difficult to get down
again without stumbling; and to crown all, Kinnaird and I had to
conduct Sheridan down a d&mdash;&mdash;d corkscrew staircase, which had
certainly been constructed before the discovery of fermented
liquors, and to which no legs, however crooked, could possibly
accommodate themselves. We deposited him safe at home, where his
man, evidently used to the business, waited to receive him in the
hall.</p>

<p>"Both he and Colman were, as usual, very good; but I carried away
much wine, and the wine had previously carried away my memory; so
that all was hiccup and happiness for the last hour or so, and I am
not impregnated with any of the conversation. Perhaps you heard of
a late answer of Sheridan to the watchman who found him bereft of
that 'divine particle of air,' called reason, * * *. He, the
watchman, who found Sherry in the street, fuddled and bewildered,
and almost insensible. 'Who are <i>you</i>, sir? '&mdash;no answer. 'What's
your name?'&mdash;a hiccup. 'What's your name?'&mdash;Answer, in a slow,
deliberate and impassive tone&mdash;'Wilberforce!!!' Is not that Sherry
all over?&mdash;and, to my mind, excellent. Poor fellow, <i>his</i> very
dregs are better than the 'first sprightly runnings' of others.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>Pg 189</span></p>

<p>"My paper is full, and I have a grievous headach.</p>

<p>"P.S. Lady B. is in full progress. Next month will bring to light
(with the aid of 'Juno Lucina, <i>fer opem</i>,' or rather <i>opes</i>, for
the last are most wanted,) the tenth wonder of the world&mdash;Gil Blas
being the eighth, and he (my son's father) the ninth."</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"November 4. 1815.</p>

<p>"Had you not bewildered my head with the 'stocks,' your letter
would have been answered directly. Hadn't I to go to the city? and
hadn't I to remember what to ask when I got there? and hadn't I
forgotten it?</p>

<p>"I should be undoubtedly delighted to see you; but I don't like to
urge against your reasons my own inclinations. Come you must soon,
for stay you <i>won't</i>. I know you of old;&mdash;you have been too much
leavened with London to keep long out of it.</p>

<p>"Lewis is going to Jamaica to suck his sugar canes. He sails in two
days; I enclose you his farewell note. I saw him last night at
D.L.T. for the last time previous to his voyage. Poor fellow! he is
really a good man&mdash;an excellent man&mdash;he left me his walking-stick
and a pot of preserved ginger. I shall never eat the last without
tears in my eyes, it is so <i>hot</i>. We have had a devil of a row
among our ballerinas. Miss Smith has been wronged about a hornpipe.
The Committee have interfered; but Byrne, the d&mdash;&mdash;d ballet master,
won't budge a step, <i>I</i> am furious, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>Pg 190</span> is George Lamb. Kinnaird is
very glad, because&mdash;he don't know why; and I am very sorry, for the
same reason. To-day I dine with Kd.&mdash;we are to have Sheridan and
Colman again; and to-morrow, once more, at Sir Gilbert Heathcote's.</p>

<p>"Leigh Hunt has written a <i>real good</i> and <i>very original Poem</i>,
which I think will be a great hit. You can have no notion how very
well it is written, nor should I, had I not redde it. As to us,
Tom&mdash;eh, when art thou out? If you think the verses worth it, I
would rather they were embalmed in the Irish Melodies, than
scattered abroad in a separate song&mdash;much rather. But when are thy
great things out? I mean the Po of Pos&mdash;thy Shah Nameh. It is very
kind in Jeffrey to like the Hebrew Melodies. Some of the fellows
here preferred Sternhold and Hopkins, and said so;&mdash;'the fiend
receive their souls therefor!'</p>

<p>"I must go and dress for dinner. Poor, dear Murat, what an end! You
know, I suppose, that his white plume used to be a rallying point
in battle, like Henry IV.'s. He refused a confessor and a bandage;
so would neither suffer his soul or body to be bandaged. You shall
have more to-morrow or next day.</p>

MS.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> you will oblige me by<span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>Pg 191</span> returning it, as, in fact, I have no
authority to let it out of my hands. I think most highly of it, and
feel anxious that you should be the publisher; but if you are not,
I do not despair of finding those who will.</p>

<p>"I have written to Mr. Leigh Hunt, stating your willingness to
treat with him, which, when I saw you, I understood you to be.
Terms and time, I leave to his pleasure and your discernment; but
this I will say, that I think it the <i>safest</i> thing you ever
engaged in. I speak to you as a man of business; were I to talk to
you as a reader or a critic, I should say it was a very wonderful
and beautiful performance, with just enough of fault to make its
beauties more remarked and remarkable.</p>

<p>"And now to the last&mdash;my own, which I feel ashamed of after the
others:&mdash;publish or not as you like, I don't care <i>one damn</i>. If
<i>you</i> don't, no one else shall, and I never thought or dreamed of
it, except as one in the collection. If it is worth being in the
fourth volume, put it there and nowhere else; and if not, put it in
the fire. Yours, N."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Those embarrassments which, from a review of his affairs previous to the
marriage, he had clearly foreseen would, before long, overtake him, were
not slow in realising his worst omens. The increased expenses induced by
his new mode of life, with but very little increase of means to meet
them,&mdash;the long arrears of early pecuniary obligations, as well as the
claims which had been, gradually, since then, accumulating, all pressed
upon him now with collected force, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>Pg 192</span> reduced him to some of the worst
humiliations of poverty. He had been even driven, by the necessity of
encountering such demands, to the trying expedient of parting with his
books,&mdash;which circumstance coming to Mr. Murray's ears, that gentleman
instantly forwarded to him 1500<i>l.</i>, with an assurance that another sum
of the same amount should be at his service in a few weeks, and that if
such assistance should not be sufficient, Mr. Murray was most ready to
dispose of the copyrights of all his past works for his use.</p>

<p>This very liberal offer Lord Byron acknowledged in the following
letter:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>LETTER 231. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

from you, if I accepted such from any man. Had such been my
intention, I can assure you I would have asked you fairly, and as
freely as you would give; and I cannot say more of my confidence or
your conduct.</p>

<p>"The circumstances which induce me to part with my books, though
sufficiently, are not <i>immediately</i>, pressing. I have made up my
mind to them, and there's an end.</p>

<p>"Had I been disposed to trespass on your kindness in this way, it
would have been before now; but I am not sorry to have an
opportunity of declining it, as it sets my opinion of you, and
indeed of human<span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>Pg 193</span> nature, in a different light from that in which I
have been accustomed to consider it.</p>

<p>The following are the lines alluded to in this note. They are written in
the loosest form of that rambling style of metre which his admiration of
Mr. Coleridge's "Christabel" led him, at this time, to adopt; and he
judged rightly, perhaps, in omitting them as the opening of his poem.
They are, however, too full of spirit and character to be lost. Though
breathing the thick atmosphere of Piccadilly when he wrote them, it is
plain that his fancy was far away, among the sunny hills and vales of
Greece; and their contrast with the tame life he was leading at the
moment, but gave to his recollections a fresher spring and force.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 232. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"January 5. 1816.</p>

<p>"I hope Mrs. M. is quite re-established. The little girl was born
on the 10th of December last; her name is Augusta <i>Ada</i> (the second
a very antique family name,&mdash;I believe not used since the reign of
King John). She was, and is, very flourishing and fat, and reckoned
very large for her days&mdash;squalls and sucks incessantly. Are you
answered? Her mother is doing very well, and up again.</p>

<p>"I have now been married a year on the second of this
month&mdash;heigh-ho! I have seen nobody lately much worth noting,
except S * * and another general of the Gauls, once or twice at
dinners out of doors. S * * is a fine, foreign, villanous-looking,
intelligent, and very agreeable man; his compatriot is more of the
<i>petit-ma&icirc;tre</i>, and younger, but I should think not at all of the
same intellectual calibre with the Corsican&mdash;which S * *, you know,
is, and a cousin of Napoleon's.</p>

<p>"Are you never to be expected in town again? To be sure, there is
no one here of the 1500 fillers of hot-rooms, called the
fashionable world. My approaching papa-ship detained us for advice,
&amp;c. &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>Pg 196</span> though I would as soon be here as any where else on this
side of the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>

of a dirge for the poor girl you mention.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> But how can I write
on one I have never seen or known? Besides, you will do it much
better yourself. I could not write upon any thing, without some
personal experience and foundation; far less on a theme so
peculiar. Now, you have both in this case; and, if you had neither,
you have more imagination, and would never fail.</p>

<p>"This is but a dull scrawl, and I am but a dull fellow. Just at
present, I am absorbed in 500 contradictory contemplations, though
with but one object in view&mdash;which will probably end in nothing, as
most things we wish do. But never mind,&mdash;as somebody says, 'for the
blue sky bends over all.' I only could be glad, if it bent over me
where it is a little bluer; like the 'skyish top of blue Olympus,'
which, by the way, looked very white when I last saw it.</p>

<p>"Ever," &amp;c.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On reading over the foregoing letter, I was much struck by the tone of
melancholy that pervaded it; and well knowing it to be the habit of the
writer's mind to seek relief, when under the pressure of any <span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name="page197"></a>Pg 197</span>disquiet
or disgust, in that sense of freedom which told him that there were
homes for him elsewhere, I could perceive, I thought, in his
recollections of the "blue Olympus," some return of the restless and
roving spirit, which unhappiness or impatience always called up in his
mind. I had, indeed, at the time when he sent me those melancholy
verses, "There's not a joy this world can give," &amp;c. felt some vague
apprehensions as to the mood into which his spirits then seemed to be
sinking, and, in acknowledging the receipt of the verses, thus tried to
banter him out of it:&mdash;"But why thus on your stool of melancholy again,
Master Stephen?&mdash;This will never do&mdash;it plays the deuce with all the
matter-of-fact duties of life, and you must bid adieu to it. Youth is
the only time when one can be melancholy with impunity. As life itself
grows sad and serious we have nothing for it but&mdash;to be as much as
possible the contrary."</p>

<p>My absence from London during the whole of this year had deprived me of
all opportunities of judging for myself how far the appearances of his
domestic state gave promise of happiness; nor had any rumours reached me
which at all inclined me to suspect that the course of his married life
hitherto exhibited less smoothness than such unions,&mdash;on the surface, at
least,&mdash;generally wear. The strong and affectionate terms in which, soon
after the marriage, he had, in some of the letters I have given,
declared his own happiness&mdash;a declaration which his known frankness left
me no room to question&mdash;had, in no small degree, tended to still those
appre<span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>Pg 198</span>hensions which my first view of the lot he had chosen for himself
awakened. I could not, however, but observe that these indications of a
contented heart soon ceased. His mention of the partner of his home
became more rare and formal, and there was observable, I thought,
through some of his letters a feeling of unquiet and weariness that
brought back all those gloomy anticipations with which I had, from the
first, regarded his fate. This last letter of his, in particular, struck
me as full of sad omen, and, in the course of my answer, I thus noticed
to him the impression it had made on me:&mdash;"And so you are a whole year
married!&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'It was last year I vow'd to thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fond impossibility.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Do you know, my dear B., there was a something in your last letter&mdash;a
sort of unquiet mystery, as well as a want of your usual elasticity of
spirits&mdash;which has hung upon my mind unpleasantly ever since. I long to
be near you, that I might know how you really look and feel; for these
letters tell nothing, and one word, <i>a quattr'occhi</i>, is worth whole
reams of correspondence. But only <i>do</i> tell me you are happier than that
letter has led me to fear, and I shall be satisfied."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was in a few weeks after this latter communication between us that
Lady Byron adopted the resolution of parting from him. She had left
London about the middle of January, on a visit to her father's house, in
Leicestershire, and Lord Byron was, in a short time after, to follow
her. They had parted<span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>Pg 199</span> in the utmost kindness,&mdash;she wrote him a letter,
full of playfulness and affection, on the road, and, immediately on her
arrival at Kirkby Mallory, her father wrote to acquaint Lord Byron that
she would return to him no more. At the time when he had to stand this
unexpected shock, his pecuniary embarrassments, which had been fast
gathering around him during the whole of the last year (there having
been no less than eight or nine executions in his house within that
period), had arrived at their utmost; and at a moment when, to use his
own strong expressions, he was "standing alone on his hearth, with his
household gods shivered around him," he was also doomed to receive the
startling intelligence that the wife who had just parted with him in
kindness, had parted with him&mdash;for ever.</p>

<p>About this time the following note was written:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>TO MR. ROGERS.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"February 8. 1816.</p>

<p>"Do not mistake me&mdash;I really returned your book for the reason
assigned, and no other. It is too good for so careless a fellow. I
have parted with all my own books, and positively won't deprive you
of so valuable 'a drop of that immortal man.'</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad to see you, if you like to call, though I am
at present contending with 'the slings and arrows of outrageous
fortune,' some of which have struck at me from a quarter whence I
did not indeed expect them&mdash;But, no matter, 'there is a world
elsewhere,' and I will cut my way through this as I can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200"></a>Pg 200</span>"If you write to Moore, will you tell him that I shall answer his
letter the moment I can muster time and spirits? Ever yours,</p>

<p>"BN."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The rumours of the separation did not reach me till more than a week
afterwards, when I immediately wrote to him thus:&mdash;"I am most anxious to
hear from you, though I doubt whether I ought to mention the subject on
which I am so anxious. If, however, what I heard last night, in a letter
from town, be true, you will know immediately what I allude to, and just
communicate as much or as little upon the subject as you think
proper;&mdash;only <i>something</i> I should like to know, as soon as possible,
from yourself, in order to set my mind at rest with respect to the truth
or falsehood of the report." The following is his answer:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>LETTER 233. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"February 29. 1816.</p>

<p>"I have not answered your letter for a time; and, at present, the
reply to part of it might extend to such a length, that I shall
delay it till it can be made in person, and then I will shorten it
as much as I can.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, I am at war 'with all the world and his wife;'
or rather, 'all the world and <i>my</i> wife' are at war with me, and
have not yet crushed me,&mdash;whatever they <i>may</i> do. I don't know that
in the course of a hair-breadth existence I was ever, at home or
abroad, in a situation so completely uprooting of present pleasure,
or rational hope for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>Pg 201</span> future, as this same. I say this, because
I think so, and feel it. But I shall not sink under it the more for
that mode of considering the question&mdash;I have made up my mind.</p>

<p>"By the way, however, you must not believe all you hear on the
subject; and don't attempt to defend me. If you succeeded in that,
it would be a mortal, or an immortal, offence&mdash;who can bear
refutation? I have but a very short answer for those whom it
concerns; and all the activity of myself and some vigorous friends
have not yet fixed on any tangible ground or personage, on which or
with whom I can discuss matters, in a summary way, with a fair
pretext;&mdash;though I nearly had <i>nailed one</i> yesterday, but he evaded
by&mdash;what was judged by others&mdash;a satisfactory explanation. I speak
of <i>circulators</i>&mdash;against whom I have no enmity, though I must act
according to the common code of usage, when I hit upon those of the
serious order.</p>

<p>"Now for other matters&mdash;poesy, for instance. Leigh Hunt's poem is a
devilish good one&mdash;quaint, here and there, but with the substratum
of originality, and with poetry about it, that will stand the test.
I do not say this because he has inscribed it to me, which I am
sorry for, as I should otherwise have begged you to review it in
the Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202"></a>Pg 202</span> really deserving of much praise, and a
favourable critique in the E.R. would but do it justice, and set it
up before the public eye where it ought to be.</p>

<p>"How are you? and where? I have not the most distant idea what I am
going to do myself, or with myself&mdash;or where&mdash;or what. I had, a few
weeks ago, some things to say that would have made you laugh; but
they tell me now that I must not laugh, and so I have been very
serious&mdash;and am.</p>

<p>"I have not been very well&mdash;with a <i>liver</i> complaint&mdash;but am much
better within the last fortnight, though still under Iatrical
advice. I have latterly seen a little of * * * *</p>

<p>"I must go and dress to dine. My little girl is in the country,
and, they tell me, is a very fine child, and now nearly three
months old. Lady Noel (my mother-in-law, or, rather, <i>at</i> law) is
at present overlooking it. Her daughter (Miss Milbanke that was)
is, I believe, in London with her father. A Mrs. C. (now a kind of
housekeeper and spy of Lady N.'s) who, in her better days, was a
washerwoman, is supposed to be&mdash;by the learned&mdash;very much the
occult cause of our late domestic discrepancies.</p>

<p>"In all this business, I am the sorriest for Sir Ralph. He and I
are equally punished, though <i>magis pares quam similes</i> in our
affliction. Yet it is hard for both to suffer for the fault of one,
and so it is&mdash;I shall be separated from my wife; he will retain
his.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In my reply to this letter, written a few days after, there is a passage
which (though containing an opinion it might have been more prudent,
perhaps, to conceal,) I feel myself called upon to extract on account of
the singularly generous avowal,&mdash;honourable alike to both the parties in
this unhappy affair,&mdash;which it was the means of drawing from Lord Byron.
The following are my words:&mdash;"I am much in the same state as yourself
with respect to the subject of your letter, my mind being so full of
things which I don't know how to write about, that <i>I</i> too must defer
the greater part of them till we meet in May, when I shall put you
fairly on your trial for all crimes and misdemeanors. In the mean time,
you will not be at a loss for judges, nor executioners either, if they
could have their will. The world, in their generous ardour to take what
they call the weaker side, soon contrive to make it most formidably the
strongest. Most sincerely do I grieve at what has happened. It has upset
all my wishes and theories as to the influence of marriage on your life;
for, instead of bringing you, as I expected, into something like a
regular orbit, it has only cast you off again into infinite space, and
left you, I fear, in a far worse state than it found you. As to
defending you, the only person with whom I have yet attempted this task
is myself; and, considering the little I know upon the subject, (or
rather, perhaps, <i>owing</i> to this cause,) I have hitherto done it with
very tolerable success. After all, your <i>choice</i> was the misfortune. I
never liked,&mdash;but I'm here wandering into the &#945;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#945;,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>Pg 204</span> and so
must change the subject for a far pleasanter one, your last new poems,
which," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The return of post brought me the following answer, which, while it
raises our admiration of the generous candour of the writer, but adds to
the sadness and strangeness of the whole transaction.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><b>LETTER 234. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"March 8. 1816.</p>

<p>"I rejoice in your promotion as Chairman and Charitable Steward,
&amp;c. &amp;c. These be dignities which await only the virtuous. But then,
recollect you are <i>six</i> and <i>thirty</i>, (I speak this enviously&mdash;not
of your age, but the 'honour&mdash;love&mdash;obedience&mdash;troops of friends,'
which accompany it,) and I have eight years good to run before I
arrive at such hoary perfection; by which time,&mdash;if I <i>am</i> at
all<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>,&mdash;it will probably be in a state of grace or progressing
merits.</p>

<p>"I must set you right in one point, however. The fault was
<i>not</i>&mdash;no, nor even the misfortune&mdash;in my 'choice' (unless in
<i>choosing at all</i>)&mdash;for I do not believe&mdash;and I must say it, in the
very dregs of all this bitter business&mdash;that there ever was a
better, or even a brighter, a kinder, or a more amiable and
agreeable being than Lady B. I never had, nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>Pg 205</span> can have, any
reproach to make her, while with me. Where there is blame, it
belongs to myself, and, if I cannot redeem, I must bear it.</p>

<p>"Her nearest relatives are a * * * *&mdash;my circumstances have been
and are in a state of great confusion&mdash;my health has been a <i>good</i>
deal disordered, and my mind ill at ease for a considerable period.
Such are the causes (I do not name them as excuses) which have
frequently driven me into excess, and disqualified my temper for
comfort. Something also may be attributed to the strange and
desultory habits which, becoming my own master at an early age, and
scrambling about, over and through the world, may have induced. I
still, however, think that, if I had had a fair chance, by being
placed in even a tolerable situation, I might have gone on fairly.
But that seems hopeless,&mdash;and there is nothing more to be said. At
present&mdash;except my health, which is better (it is odd, but
agitation or contest of any kind gives a rebound to my spirits and
sets me up for the time)&mdash;I have to battle with all kinds of
unpleasantnesses, including private and pecuniary difficulties, &amp;c.
&amp;c.</p>

<p>"I believe I may have said this before to you, but I risk repeating
it. It is nothing to bear the <i>privations</i> of adversity, or, more
properly, ill fortune; but my pride recoils from its <i>indignities</i>.
However, I have no quarrel with that same pride, which will, I
think, buckler me through every thing. If my heart could have been
broken, it would have been so years ago, and by events more
afflicting than these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206"></a>Pg 206</span>"I agree with you (to turn from this topic to our shop) that I
have written too much. The last things were, however, published
very reluctantly by me, and for reasons I will explain when we
meet. I know not why I have dwelt so much on the same scenes,
except that I find them fading, or <i>confusing</i> (if such a word may
be) in my memory, in the midst of present turbulence and pressure,
and I felt anxious to stamp before the die was worn out. I now
break it. With those countries, and events connected with them, all
my really poetical feelings begin and end. Were I to try, I could
make nothing of any other subject, and that I have apparently
exhausted. 'Wo to him,' says Voltaire, 'who says all he could say
on any subject.' There are some on which, perhaps, I could have
said still more: but I leave them all, and too soon.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the lines I sent you early last year, which you
still have? I don't wish (like Mr. Fitzgerald, in the Morning Post)
to claim the character of 'Vates' in all its translations, but were
they not a little prophetic? I mean those beginning, 'There's not a
joy the world can,' &amp;c. &amp;c., on which I rather pique myself as
being the truest, though the most melancholy, I ever wrote.</p>

<p>"What a scrawl have I sent you! You say nothing of yourself, except
that you are a Lancasterian churchwarden, and an encourager of
mendicants. When are you out? and how is your family? My child is
very well and flourishing, I hear; but I must see also. I feel no
disposition to resign it to the contagion of its grandmother's
society, though I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>Pg 207</span> am unwilling to take it from the mother. It is
weaned, however, and something about it must be decided. Ever," &amp;c.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Having already gone so far in laying open to my readers some of the
sentiments which I entertained, respecting Lord Byron's marriage, at a
time when, little foreseeing that I should ever become his biographer, I
was, of course, uninfluenced by the peculiar bias supposed to belong to
that task, it may still further, perhaps, be permitted me to extract
from my reply to the foregoing letter some sentences of explanation
which its contents seemed to me to require.</p>

<p>"I had certainly no right to say any thing about the unluckiness of your
choice, though I rejoice now that I did, as it has drawn from you a
tribute which, however unaccountable and mysterious it renders the whole
affair, is highly honourable to both parties. What I meant in hinting a
doubt with respect to the object of your selection did not imply the
least impeachment of that perfect amiableness which the world, I find,
by common consent, allows to her. I only feared that she might have been
too perfect&mdash;too <i>precisely</i> excellent&mdash;too matter-of-fact a paragon for
you to coalesce with comfortably; and that a person whose perfection
hung in more easy folds about her, whose brightness was softened down by
some of 'those fair defects which best conciliate love,' would, by
appealing more dependently to your protection, have stood a much better
chance with<span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208"></a>Pg 208</span> your good nature. All these suppositions, however, I have
been led into by my intense anxiety to acquit you of any thing like a
capricious abandonment of such a woman<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>; and, totally in the dark as
I am with respect to all but the fact of your separation, you cannot
conceive the solicitude, the fearful solicitude, with which I look
forward to a history of the transaction from your own lips when we
meet,&mdash;a history in which I am sure of, at least, <i>one</i> virtue&mdash;manly
candour."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>With respect to the causes that may be supposed to have led to this
separation, it seems needless, with the characters of both parties
before our eyes, to go in quest of any very remote or mysterious reasons
to account for it. I have already, in some observations on the general
character of men of genius, endeavoured to point out those
peculiarities, both in disposition and habitudes, by which, in the far
greater number of instances, they have been found unfitted for domestic
happiness. Of these defects, (which are, as it were, the shadow that
genius casts, and too generally, it is to be feared, in proportion to
its stature,) Lord Byron could not, of course, fail to have inherited
his share, in common with all the painfully-gifted class to which he
belonged. How thoroughly, with respect to one attribute of this
temperament which he possessed,&mdash;one, that "sicklies o'er" the face of
happiness itself,&mdash;he was un<span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>Pg 209</span>derstood by the person most interested in
observing him, will appear from the following anecdote, as related by
himself.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>"People have wondered at the melancholy which runs through my writings.
Others have wondered at my personal gaiety. But I recollect once, after
an hour in which I had been sincerely and particularly gay and rather
brilliant, in company, my wife replying to me when I said (upon her
remarking my high spirits), 'And yet, Bell, I have been called and
miscalled melancholy&mdash;you must have seen how falsely, frequently?'&mdash;'No,
Byron,' she answered, 'it is not so: at heart you are the most
melancholy of mankind; and often when apparently gayest.'"</p>

<p>To these faults and sources of faults inherent, in his own sensitive
nature, he added also many of those which a long indulgence of self-will
generates,&mdash;the least compatible, of all others, (if not softened down,
as they were in him, by good nature,) with that system of mutual
concession and sacrifice by which the balance of domestic peace is
maintained. When we look back, indeed, to the unbridled career, of which
this marriage was meant to be the goal,&mdash;to the rapid and restless
course in which his life had run along, like a burning train, through a
series of wanderings, adventures, successes, and passions, the fever of
all which was still upon him, when, with the same headlong recklessness,
he rushed into this marriage,&mdash;it can but little surprise us that, in
the space of one short year, he should not have been able to re<span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>Pg 210</span>cover
all at once from his bewilderment, or to settle down into that tame
level of conduct which the close observers of his every action required.
As well might it be expected that a steed like his own Mazeppa's,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wild as the wild deer and untaught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With spur and bridle undefiled&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas but a day he had been caught,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>should stand still, when reined, without chafing or champing the bit.</p>

<p>Even had the new condition of life into which he passed been one of
prosperity and smoothness, some time, as well as tolerance, must still
have been allowed for the subsiding of so excited a spirit into rest.
But, on the contrary, his marriage (from the reputation, no doubt, of
the lady, as an heiress,) was, at once, a signal for all the arrears and
claims of a long-accumulating state of embarrassment to explode upon
him;&mdash;his door was almost daily beset by duns, and his house nine times
during that year in possession of bailiffs<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>; while, in addition to
these<span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>Pg 211</span> anxieties and&mdash;what he felt still more&mdash;indignities of poverty,
he had also the pain of fancying, whether rightly or wrongly, that the
eyes of enemies and spies were upon him, even under his own roof, and
that his every hasty word and look were interpreted in the most
perverting light.</p>

<p>As, from the state of their means, his lady and he saw but little
society, his only relief from the thoughts which a life of such
embarrassment brought with it was in those avocations which his duty, as
a member of the Drury Lane Committee, imposed upon him. And here,&mdash;in
this most unlucky connection with the theatre,&mdash;one of the fatalities of
his short year of trial, as husband, lay. From the reputation which he
had previously acquired for gallantries, and the sort of reckless and
boyish levity to which&mdash;often in very "bitterness of soul"&mdash;he gave way,
it was not difficult to bring suspicion upon some of those acquaintances
which his frequent intercourse with the green-room induced him to form,
or even (as, in one instance, was the case,) to connect with his name
injuriously that of a person to whom he had scarcely ever addressed a
single word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>Pg 212</span>Notwithstanding, however, this ill-starred concurrence of
circumstances, which might have palliated any excesses either of temper
or conduct into which they drove him, it was, after all, I am persuaded,
to no such serious causes that the unfortunate alienation, which so soon
ended in disunion, is to be traced. "In all the marriages I have ever
seen," says Steele, "most of which have been unhappy ones, the great
cause of evil has proceeded from slight occasions;" and to this remark,
I think, the marriage under our consideration would not be found, upon
enquiry, to be an exception. Lord Byron himself, indeed, when at
Cephalonia, a short time before his death, seems to have expressed, in a
few words, the whole pith of the mystery. An English gentleman with whom
he was conversing on the subject of Lady Byron, having ventured to
enumerate to him the various causes he had heard alleged for the
separation, the noble poet, who had seemed much amused with their
absurdity and falsehood, said, after listening to them all,&mdash;"The
causes, my dear sir, were too simple to be easily found out."</p>

<p>In truth, the circumstances, so unexampled, that attended their
separation,&mdash;the last words of the parting wife to the husband being
those of the most playful affection, while the language of the deserted
husband towards the wife was in a strain, as the world knows, of
tenderest eulogy,&mdash;are in themselves a sufficient proof that, at the
time of their parting, there could have been no very deep sense of
injury on either side. It was not till afterwards that, in both bosoms,
the repulsive force came into<span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>Pg 213</span> operation,&mdash;when, to the party which had
taken the first decisive step in the strife, it became naturally a point
of pride to persevere in it with dignity, and this unbendingness
provoked, as naturally, in the haughty spirit of the other, a strong
feeling of resentment which overflowed, at last, in acrimony and scorn.
If there be any truth, however, in the principle, that they "never
pardon who have done the wrong," Lord Byron, who was, to the last,
disposed to reconciliation, proved so far, at least, his conscience to
have been unhaunted by any very disturbing consciousness of aggression.</p>

<p>But though it would have been difficult, perhaps, for the victims of
this strife, themselves, to have pointed out any single, or definite,
cause for their disunion,&mdash;beyond that general incompatibility which is
the canker of all such marriages,&mdash;the public, which seldom allows
itself to be at a fault on these occasions, was, as usual, ready with an
ample supply of reasons for the breach,&mdash;all tending to blacken the
already darkly painted character of the poet, and representing him, in
short, as a finished monster of cruelty and depravity. The reputation of
the object of his choice for every possible virtue, (a reputation which
had been, I doubt not, one of his own chief incentives to the marriage,
from the vanity, reprobate as he knew he was deemed, of being able to
win such a paragon,) was now turned against him by his assailants, not
only in the way of contrast with his own character, but as if the
excellences of the wife were proof positive of every enormity they chose
to charge upon the husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>Pg 214</span>Meanwhile, the unmoved silence of the lady herself, (from motives, it
is but fair to suppose, of generosity and delicacy,) under the repeated
demands made for a specification of her charges against him, left to
malice and imagination the fullest range for their combined industry. It
was accordingly stated, and almost universally believed, that the noble
lord's second proposal to Miss Milbanke had been but with a view to
revenge himself for the slight inflicted by her refusal of the first,
and that he himself had confessed so much to her on their way from
church. At the time when, as the reader has seen from his own honey-moon
letters, he was, with all the good will in the world, imagining himself
into happiness, and even boasting, in the pride of his fancy, that if
marriage were to be upon <i>lease</i>, he would gladly renew his own for a
term of ninety-nine years,&mdash;at this very time, according to these
veracious chroniclers, he was employed in darkly following up the
aforesaid scheme of revenge, and tormenting his lady by all sorts of
unmanly cruelties,&mdash;such as firing off pistols, to frighten her as she
lay in bed<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>, and other such freaks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>Pg 215</span>To the falsehoods concerning his green-room intimacies, and
particularly with respect to one beautiful actress, with whom, in
reality, he had hardly ever exchanged a single word, I have already
adverted; and the extreme confidence with which this tale was circulated
and believed affords no unfair specimen of the sort of evidence with
which the public, in all such fits of moral wrath, is satisfied. It is,
at the same time, very far from my intention to allege that, in the
course of the noble poet's intercourse with the theatre, he was not
sometimes led into a line of acquaintance and converse, unbefitting, if
not dangerous to, the steadiness of married life. But the imputations
against him on this head were (as far as affected his conjugal
character) not the less unfounded,&mdash;as the sole case in which he
afforded any thing like <i>real</i> grounds for such an accusation did not
take place till <i>after</i> the period of the separation.</p>

<p>Not content with such ordinary and tangible charges, the tongue of
rumour was emboldened to proceed still further; and, presuming upon the
mysterious silence maintained by one of the parties, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>Pg 216</span>ventured to throw
out dark hints and vague insinuations, of which the fancy of every
hearer was left to fill up the outline as he pleased. In consequence of
all this exaggeration, such an outcry was now raised against Lord Byron
as, in no case of private life, perhaps, was ever before witnessed; nor
had the whole amount of fame which he had gathered, in the course of the
last four years, much exceeded in proportion the reproach and obloquy
that were now, within the space of a few weeks, showered upon him. In
addition to the many who, no doubt, conscientiously believed and
reprobated what they had but too much right, whether viewing him as poet
or man of fashion, to consider credible excesses, there were also
actively on the alert that large class of persons who seem to hold
violence against the vices of others to be equivalent to virtue in
themselves, together with all those natural haters of success who,
having long sickened under the splendour of the <i>poet</i>, were now
enabled, in the guise of champions for innocence, to wreak their spite
on the <i>man</i>. In every various form of paragraph, pamphlet, and
caricature, both his character and person were held up to
odium<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>;&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217"></a>Pg 217</span>hardly a voice was raised, or at least listened to, in his
behalf; and though a few faithful friends remained unshaken by his side,
the utter hopelessness of stemming the torrent was felt as well by them
as by himself, and, after an effort or two to gain a fair hearing, they
submitted in silence. Among the few attempts made by himself towards
confuting his calumniators was an appeal (such as the following short
letter contains) to some of those persons with whom he had been in the
habit of living familiarly.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 235. TO MR. ROGERS.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"March 25. 1816.</p>

<p>"You are one of the few persons with whom I have lived in what is
called intimacy, and have heard me at times conversing on the
untoward topic of my recent family disquietudes. Will you have the
goodness to say to me at once, whether you ever heard me speak of
her with disrespect, with unkindness, or defending myself at <i>her</i>
expense by any serious imputation of any description against<span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>Pg 218</span>
<i>her</i>? Did you never hear me say 'that when there was a right or a
wrong, she had the <i>right</i>?'&mdash;The reason I put these questions to
you or others of my friends is, because I am said, by her and hers,
to have resorted to such means of exculpation.</p>

<p>"Ever very truly yours,</p>

<p>"B."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In those Memoirs (or, more properly, Memoranda,) of the noble poet,
which it was thought expedient, for various reasons, to sacrifice, he
gave a detailed account of all the circumstances connected with his
marriage, from the first proposal to the lady till his own departure,
after the breach, from England. In truth, though the title of "Memoirs,"
which he himself sometimes gave to that manuscript, conveys the idea of
a complete and regular piece of biography, it was to this particular
portion of his life that the work was principally devoted; while the
anecdotes, having reference to other parts of his career, not only
occupied a very disproportionate space in its pages, but were most of
them such as are found repeated in the various Journals and other MSS.
he left behind. The chief charm, indeed, of that narrative, was the
melancholy playfulness&mdash;melancholy, from the wounded feeling so visible
through its pleasantry&mdash;with which events unimportant and persons
uninteresting, in almost every respect but their connection with such a
man's destiny, were detailed and described in it. Frank, as usual,
throughout, in his avowal of his own errors, and generously just towards
her who was his fellow-<span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219"></a>Pg 219</span>sufferer in the strife, the impression his
recital left on the minds of all who perused it was, to say the least,
favourable to him;&mdash;though, upon the whole, leading to a persuasion,
which I have already intimated to be my own, that, neither in kind nor
degree, did the causes of disunion between the parties much differ from
those that loosen the links of most such marriages.</p>

<p>With respect to the details themselves, though all important in his own
eyes at the time, as being connected with the subject that superseded
most others in his thoughts, the interest they would possess for others,
now that their first zest as a subject of scandal is gone by, and the
greater number of the persons to whom they relate forgotten, would be
too slight to justify me in entering upon them more particularly, or
running the risk of any offence that might be inflicted by their
disclosure. As far as the character of the illustrious subject of these
pages is concerned, I feel that Time and Justice are doing far more in
its favour than could be effected by any such gossiping details. During
the lifetime of a man of genius, the world is but too much inclined to
judge of him rather by what he wants than by what he possesses, and even
where conscious, as in the present case, that his defects are among the
sources of his greatness, to require of him unreasonably the one without
the other. If Pope had not been splenetic and irritable, we should have
wanted his Satires; and an impetuous temperament, and passions untamed,
were indispensable to the conformation of a poet like Byron. It is by
posterity only that full justice is<span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>Pg 220</span> rendered to those who have paid
such hard penalties to reach it. The dross that had once hung about the
ore drops away, and the infirmities, and even miseries, of genius are
forgotten in its greatness. Who now asks whether Dante was right or
wrong in his matrimonial differences? or by how many of those whose
fancies dwell fondly on his Beatrice is even the name of his Gemma
Donati remembered?</p>

<p>Already, short as has been the interval since Lord Byron's death, the
charitable influence of time in softening, if not rescinding, the harsh
judgments of the world against genius is visible. The utter
unreasonableness of trying such a character by ordinary standards, or of
expecting to find the materials of order and happiness in a bosom
constantly heaving forth from its depths such "lava floods," is&mdash;now
that big spirit has passed from among us&mdash;felt and acknowledged. In
reviewing the circumstances of his marriage, a more even scale of
justice is held; and while every tribute of sympathy and commiseration
is accorded to her, who, unluckily for her own peace, became involved in
such a destiny,&mdash;who, with virtues and attainments that would have made
the home of a more ordinary man happy, undertook, in evil hour, to "turn
and wind a fiery Pegasus," and but failed where it may be doubted
whether even the fittest for such a task would have succeeded,&mdash;full
allowance is, at the same time, made for the great martyr of genius
himself, whom so many other causes, beside that restless fire within
him, concurred to unsettle in mind and (as he himself feelingly
expresses it) "disqualify for comfort;"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221"></a>Pg 221</span>whose doom it was to be either
thus or less great, and whom to have tamed might have been to
extinguish; there never, perhaps, having existed an individual to whom,
whether as author or man, the following line was more applicable:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>While these events were going on,&mdash;events, of which his memory and heart
bore painfully the traces through the remainder of his short life,&mdash;some
occurrences took place, connected with his literary history, to which it
is a relief to divert the attention of the reader from the distressing
subject that has now so long detained us.</p>

<p>The letter that follows was in answer to one received from Mr. Murray,
in which that gentleman had enclosed him a draft for a thousand guineas
for the copyright of his two poems, The Siege of Corinth and Parisina:&mdash;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><b>LETTER 236. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"January 3. 1816.</p>

<p>"Your offer is <i>liberal</i> in the extreme, (you see I use the word
<i>to</i> you and <i>of</i> you, though I would not consent to your using it
of yourself to Mr. * * * *,) and much more than the two poems can
possibly be worth; but I cannot accept it, nor will not. You are
most welcome to them as additions to the collected volumes, without
any demand or expectation on my part whatever. But I cannot consent
to their separate publication. I do not like to risk any fame<span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>Pg 222</span>
(whether merited or not), which I have been favoured with, upon
compositions which I do not feel to be at all equal to my own
notions of what they should be, (and as I flatter myself some <i>have
been</i>, here and there,) though they may do very well as things
without pretension, to add to the publication with the lighter
pieces.</p>

<p>"I am very glad that the handwriting was a favourable omen of the
<i>morale</i> of the piece: but you must not trust to that, for my
copyist would write out any thing I desired in all the ignorance of
innocence&mdash;I hope, however, in this instance, with no great peril
to either.</p>

<p>"P.S. I have enclosed your draft <i>torn</i>, for fear of accidents by
the way&mdash;I wish you would not throw temptation in mine. It is not
from a disdain of the universal idol, nor from a present
superfluity of his treasures, I can assure you, that I refuse to
worship him; but what is right is right, and must not yield to
circumstances."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Notwithstanding the ruinous state of his pecuniary affairs, the
resolution which the poet had formed not to avail himself of the profits
of his works still continued to be held sacred by him; and the sum thus
offered for the copyright of The Siege of Corinth and Parisina was, as
we see, refused and left untouched in the publisher's hands. It happened
that, at this time, a well-known and eminent writer on political science
had been, by some misfortune, reduced to pecuniary embarrassment; and
the circumstance having become known to Mr. Rogers and Sir James
Mackin<span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>Pg 223</span>tosh, it occurred to them that a part of the sum thus
unappropriated by Lord Byron could not be better bestowed than in
relieving the necessities of this gentleman. The suggestion was no
sooner conveyed to the noble poet than he proceeded to act upon it; and
the following letter to Mr. Rogers refers to his intentions:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>LETTER 237. TO MR. ROGERS.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"February 20. 1816.</p>

<p>"I wrote to you hastily this morning by Murray, to say that I was
glad to do as Mackintosh and you suggested about Mr. * *. It occurs
to me now, that as I have never seen Mr. * * but once, and
consequently have no claim to his acquaintance, that you or Sir J.
had better arrange it with him in such a manner as may be least
offensive to his feelings, and so as not to have the appearance of
officiousness nor obtrusion on my part. I hope you will be able to
do this, as I should be very sorry to do any thing by him that may
be deemed indelicate. The sum Murray offered and offers was and is
one thousand and fifty pounds:&mdash;this I refused before, because I
thought it more than the two things were worth to Murray, and from
other objections, which are of no consequence. I have, however,
closed with M., in consequence of Sir J.'s and your suggestion, and
propose the sum of six hundred pounds to be transferred to Mr. * *
in such a manner as may seem best to your friend,&mdash;the remainder I
think of for other purposes.</p>

<p>"As Murray has offered the money down for the copyrights, it may be
done directly. I am ready to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224"></a>Pg 224</span> sign and seal immediately, and
perhaps it had better not be delayed. I shall feel very glad if it
can be of any use to * *; only don't let him be plagued, nor think
himself obliged and all that, which makes people hate one another,
&amp;c. Yours, very truly,</p>

<p>"B."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In his mention here of other "purposes," he refers to an intention which
he had of dividing the residue of the sum between two other gentlemen of
literary Celebrity, equally in want of such aid, Mr. Maturin and Mr. * *.
The whole design, however, though entered into with the utmost
sincerity on the part of the noble poet, ultimately failed. Mr. Murray,
who was well acquainted with the straits to which Lord Byron himself had
been reduced, and foresaw that a time might come when even money thus
gained would be welcome to him, on learning the uses to which the sum
was to be applied, demurred in advancing it,&mdash;alleging that, though
bound not only by his word but his will to pay the amount to Lord Byron,
he did not conceive himself called upon to part with it to others. How
earnestly the noble poet himself, though with executions, at the time,
impending over his head, endeavoured to urge the point, will appear from
the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>LETTER 238. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"February 22. 1815.</p>

<p>"When the sum offered by you, and even <i>pressed</i> by you, was
declined, it was with reference to a separate publication, as you
know and I know. That it<span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name="page225"></a>Pg 225</span> was large, I admitted and admit; and
<i>that</i> made part of my consideration in refusing it, till I knew
better what you were likely to make of it. With regard to what is
past, or is to pass, about Mr. M * *, the case is in no respect
different from the transfer of former copyrights to Mr. Dallas. Had
I taken you at your word, that is, taken your money, I might have
used it as I pleased; and it could be in no respect different to
you whether I paid it to a w&mdash;&mdash;, or a hospital, or assisted a man
of talent in distress. The truth of the matter seems this: you
offered more than the poems are worth. I <i>said</i> so, and I <i>think</i>
so; but you know, or at least ought to know, your own business
best; and when you recollect what passed between you and me upon
pecuniary subjects before this occurred, you will acquit me of any
wish to take advantage of your imprudence.</p>

<p>"The things in question shall not be published at all, and there is
an end of the matter.</p>

<p>"Yours," &amp;c.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The letter that follows will give some idea of those embarrassments in
his own affairs, under the pressure of which he could be thus
considerate of the wants of others.</p>

about the matter. This is about the tenth execution in as many
months; so I am pretty well hardened; but it is fit I should pay
the forfeit of my forefathers' extravagance and my own; and
whatever my faults may be, I suppose they will be pretty well
expiated in time&mdash;or eternity. Ever, &amp;c.</p>

<p>During the month of January and part of February, his poems of The Siege
of Corinth and Parisina were in the hands of the printers, and about the
end of the latter month made their appearance. The following letters are
the only ones I find connected with their publication.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 240. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"February 3. 1816.</p>

<p>"I sent for 'Marmion,' which I return, because it occurred to me,
there might be a resemblance between part of 'Parisina' and a
similar scene in Canto 2d of 'Marmion.' I fear there is, though I
never thought of it before, and could hardly wish to imitate that
which is inimitable. I wish you would ask Mr. Gifford whether I
ought to say any thing upon it;&mdash;I had completed the story on the
passage from Gibbon, which indeed leads to a like scene naturally,
without a thought of the kind: but it comes upon me not very
comfortably.</p>

<p>"There are a few words and phrases I want to alter in the MS., and
should like to do it before you print, and will return it in an
hour.</p>

<p>"Yours ever."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><b>LETTER 241. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"February 20. 1816.</p>

<p>"To return to our business&mdash;your epistles are vastly agreeable.
With regard to the observations on carelessness, &amp;c. I think, with
all humility, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228"></a>Pg 228</span> the gentle reader has considered a rather
uncommon, and designedly irregular, versification for haste and
negligence. The measure is not that of any of the other poems,
which (I believe) were allowed to be tolerably correct, according
to Byshe and the fingers&mdash;or ears&mdash;by which bards write, and
readers reckon. Great part of 'The Siege' is in (I think) what the
learned call Anapests, (though I am not sure, being heinously
forgetful of my metres and my 'Gradus',) and many of the lines
intentionally longer or shorter than its rhyming companion; and
rhyme also occurring at greater or less intervals of caprice or
convenience.</p>

<p>"I mean not to say that this is right or good, but merely that I
could have been smoother, had it appeared to me of advantage; and
that I was not otherwise without being aware of the deviation,
though I now feel sorry for it, as I would undoubtedly rather
please than not. My wish has been to try at something different
from my former efforts; as I endeavoured to make them differ from
each other. The versification of 'The Corsair' is not that of
'Lara;' nor 'The Giaour' that of 'The Bride;' Childe Harold is
again varied from these; and I strove to vary the last somewhat
from <i>all</i> of the others.</p>

<p>"Excuse all this d&mdash;&mdash;d nonsense and egotism. The fact is, that I
am rather trying to think on the subject of this note, than really
thinking on it.&mdash;I did not know you had called: you are always
admitted and welcome when you choose.</p>

<p>"Yours, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229"></a>Pg 229</span>"P.S. You need not be in any apprehension or grief on my account:
were I to be beaten down by the world and its inheritors, I should
have succumbed to many things, years ago. You must not mistake my
<i>not</i> bullying for dejection; nor imagine that because I feel, I am
to faint:&mdash;but enough for the present.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for Sotheby's row. What the devil is it about? I
thought it all settled; and if I can do any thing about him or Ivan
still, I am ready and willing. I do not think it proper for me just
now to be much behind the scenes, but I will see the committee and
move upon it, if Sotheby likes.</p>

<p>"If you see Mr. Sotheby, will you tell him that I wrote to Mr.
Coleridge, on getting Mr. Sotheby's note, and have, I hope, done
what Mr. S. wished on that subject?"</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was about the middle of April that his two celebrated copies of
verses, "Fare thee well," and "A Sketch," made their appearance in the
newspapers:&mdash;and while the latter poem was generally and, it must be
owned, justly condemned, as a sort of literary assault on an obscure
female, whose situation ought to have placed her as much <i>beneath</i> his
satire as the undignified mode of his attack certainly raised her
<i>above</i> it, with regard to the other poem, opinions were a good deal
more divided. To many it appeared a strain of true conjugal tenderness,
a kind of appeal, which no woman with a heart could resist: while by
others, on the contrary, it was considered to be a mere showy effusion
of sentiment, as difficult<span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230"></a>Pg 230</span> for real feeling to have produced as it was
easy for fancy and art, and altogether unworthy of the deep interests
involved in the subject. To this latter opinion, I confess my own to
have, at first, strongly inclined; and suspicious as I could not help
regarding the sentiment that could, at such a moment, indulge in such
verses, the taste that prompted or sanctioned their publication appeared
to me even still more questionable. On reading, however, his own account
of all the circumstances in the Memoranda, I found that on both points I
had, in common with a large portion of the public, done him injustice.
He there described, and in a manner whose sincerity there was no
doubting, the swell of tender recollections under the influence of
which, as he sat one night musing in his study, these stanzas were
produced,&mdash;the tears, as he said, falling fast over the paper as he
wrote them. Neither, from that account, did it appear to have been from
any wish or intention of his own, but through the injudicious zeal of a
friend whom he had suffered to take a copy, that the verses met the
public eye.</p>

<p>The appearance of these poems gave additional violence to the angry and
inquisitorial feeling now abroad against him; and the title under which
both pieces were immediately announced by various publishers, as "Poems
by Lord Byron on his domestic Circumstances," carried with it a
sufficient exposure of the utter unfitness of such themes for rhyme. It
is, indeed, only in those emotions and passions, of which imagination
forms a predominant ingredient,&mdash;such as love, in its first dreams,
before reality has<span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231"></a>Pg 231</span> come to embody or dispel them, or sorrow, in its
wane, when beginning to pass away from the heart into the fancy,&mdash;that
poetry ought ever to be employed as an interpreter of feeling. For the
expression of all those immediate affections and disquietudes that have
their root in the actual realities of life, the art of the poet, from
the very circumstance of its being an art, as well as from the coloured
form in which it is accustomed to transmit impressions, cannot be
otherwise than a medium as false as it is feeble.</p>

<p>To so very low an ebb had the industry of his assailants now succeeded
in reducing his private character, that it required no small degree of
courage, even among that class who are supposed to be the most tolerant
of domestic irregularities, to invite him into their society. One
distinguished lady of fashion, however, ventured so far as, on the eve
of his departure from England, to make a party for him expressly; and
nothing short, perhaps, of that high station in society which a life as
blameless as it is brilliant has secured to her, could have placed
beyond all reach of misrepresentation, at that moment, such a compliment
to one marked with the world's censure so deeply. At this assembly of
Lady J * *'s he made his last appearance, publicly, in England; and the
amusing account given of some of the company in his Memoranda,&mdash;of the
various and characteristic ways in which the temperature of their manner
towards him was affected by the cloud under which he now appeared,&mdash;was
one of the passages of that Memoir it would have been most desirable,
perhaps, to have preserved; though, from being a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232"></a>Pg 232</span> gallery of sketches,
all personal and many satirical, but a small portion of it, if any,
could have been presented to the public till a time when the originals
had long left the scene, and any interest they might once have excited
was gone with themselves. Besides the noble hostess herself, whose
kindness to him, on this occasion, he never forgot, there was also one
other person (then Miss M * *, now Lady K * *,) whose frank and fearless
cordiality to him on that evening he most gratefully
commemorated,&mdash;adding, in acknowledgment of a still more generous
service, "She is a high-minded woman, and showed me more friendship than
I deserved from her. I heard also of her having defended me in a large
company, which <i>at that time</i> required more courage and firmness than
most women possess."</p>

<p>As we are now approaching so near the close of his London life, I shall
here throw together the few remaining recollections of that period with
which the gleanings of his Memorandum-book, so often referred to,
furnish me.</p>

<p>"I liked the Dandies; they were always very civil to <i>me</i>, though in
general they disliked literary people, and persecuted and mystified
Madame de Sta&euml;l, Lewis, * * * *, and the like, damnably. They persuaded
Madame de Sta&euml;l that A * * had a hundred thousand a year, &amp;c. &amp;c., till
she praised him to his <i>face</i> for his <i>beauty</i>! and made a set at him
for * *, and a hundred fooleries besides. The truth is, that, though I
gave up the business early,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page233" name="page233"></a>Pg 233</span> I had a tinge of dandyism<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> in my
minority, and probably retained enough of it to conciliate the great
ones at five-and-twenty. I had gamed, and drank, and taken my degrees in
most dissipations, and having no pedantry, and not being overbearing, we
ran quietly together. I knew them all more or less, and they made me a
member of Watier's (a superb club at that time), being, I take it, the
only literary man (except <i>two others</i>, both men of the world, Moore and
Spenser,) in it. Our masquerade<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> was a grand one; so was the
dandy-ball too, at the Argyle, but <i>that</i> (the latter) was given by the
four chiefs, B., M., A., and P., if I err not.</p>

<p>"I was a member of the Alfred, too, being elected while in Greece. It
was pleasant; a little too sober and literary, and bored with * * and
Sir Francis D'Ivernois; but one met Peel, and Ward, and Valentia, and
many other pleasant or known people; and it was, upon the whole, a
decent resource in a rainy day, in a dearth of parties, or parliament,
or in an empty season.</p>

<p>"I belonged, or belong, to the following clubs or societies:&mdash;to the
Alfred; to the Cocoa Tree; to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>Pg 234</span> Watier's; to the Union; to Racket's (at
Brighton); to the Pugilistic; to the Owls, or "Fly-by-night;" to the
<i>Cambridge</i> Whig Club; to the Harrow Club, Cambridge; and to one or two
private clubs; to the Hampden (political) Club; and to the Italian
Carbonari, &amp;c. &amp;c., 'though last, <i>not least</i>.' I got into all these,
and never stood for any other&mdash;at least to my own knowledge. I declined
being proposed to several others, though pressed to stand candidate."</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>"When I met H * * L * *, the gaoler, at Lord Holland's, before he sailed
for St. Helena, the discourse turned upon the battle of Waterloo. I
asked him whether the dispositions of Napoleon were those of a great
general? He answered, disparagingly, 'that they were very simple.' I had
always thought that a degree of simplicity was an ingredient of
greatness."</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>"I was much struck with the simplicity of Grattan's manners in private
life; they were odd, but they were natural. Curran used to take him off,
bowing to the very ground, and 'thanking God that he had no
peculiarities of gesture or appearance,' in a way irresistibly
ludicrous; and * * used to call him a 'Sentimental Harlequin.'"</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>"Curran! Curran's the man who struck me most<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. Such imagination!
there never was any <span class="pagenum"><a id="page235" name="page235"></a>Pg 235</span>thing like it that ever I saw or heard of. His
<i>published</i> life&mdash;his published speeches, give you <i>no</i> idea of the
man&mdash;none at all. He was a <i>machine</i> of imagination, as some one said
that Piron was an epigrammatic machine.</p>

<p>"I did not see a great deal of Curran&mdash;only in 1813; but I met him at
home (for he used to call on me), and in society, at Mackintosh's,
Holland House, &amp;c. &amp;c. and he was wonderful even to me, who had seen
many remarkable men of the time."</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>"* * * (commonly called <i>long</i> * * *, a very clever man, but odd)
complained of our friend Scrope B. Davies, in riding, that he had a
<i>stitch</i> in his side. 'I don't wonder at it,' said Scrope, 'for you ride
<i>like a tailor</i>.' Whoever had seen * * * on horseback, with his very
tall figure on a small nag, would not deny the justice of the repartee."</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>"When B * * was obliged (by that affair of poor M * *, who thence
acquired the name of 'Dick the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name="page236"></a>Pg 236</span> Dandy-killer'&mdash;it was about money, and
debt, and all that) to retire to France, he knew no French, and having
obtained a grammar for the purpose of study, our friend Scrope Davies
was asked what progress Brummell had made in French; he responded, 'that
Brummell had been stopped, like Buonaparte in Russia, by the Elements.'</p>

<p>"I have put this pun into Beppo, which is 'a fair exchange and no
robbery; for Scrope made his fortune at several dinners (as he owned
himself) by repeating occasionally, as his own, some of the buffooneries
with which I had encountered him in the morning."</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>"* * * is a good man, rhymes well (if not wisely), but is a bore. He
seizes you by the button. One night of a rout, at Mrs. Hope's, he had
fastened upon me, notwithstanding my symptoms of manifest distress, (for
I was in love, and had just nicked a minute when neither mothers, nor
husbands, nor rivals, nor gossips, were near my then idol, who was
beautiful as the statues of the gallery where we stood at the time,)&mdash;*
* *, I say, had seized upon me by the button and the heart-strings, and
spared neither. W. Spencer, who likes fun, and don't dislike mischief,
saw my case, and coming up to us both, took me by the hand, and
pathetically bade me farewell; 'for,' said he, 'I see it is all over
with you.' * * * then went away. <i>Sic me servavit Apollo.</i>"</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>"I remember seeing Blucher in the London assemblies, and never saw any
thing of his age less<span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>Pg 237</span> venerable. With the voice and manners of a
recruiting sergeant, he pretended to the honours of a hero,&mdash;just as if
a stone could be worshipped because a man had stumbled over it."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We now approach the close of this eventful period of his history. In a
note to Mr. Rogers, written a short time before his departure for
Ostend<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>, he says,&mdash;"My sister is now with me, and leaves town
to-morrow: we shall not meet again for some time, at all events&mdash;if
ever; and, under these circumstances, I trust to stand excused to you
and Mr. Sheridan for being unable to wait upon him this evening."</p>

<p>This was his last interview with his sister,&mdash;almost the only person
from whom he now parted with regret; it being, as he said, doubtful
<i>which</i> had given him most pain, the enemies who attacked or the friends
who condoled with him. Those beautiful and most tender verses, "Though
the day of my destiny's over," were now his parting tribute to her<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
who, through all this bitter trial, had been his sole consolation; and,
though known to most readers, so expressive are they of his wounded
feelings at this crisis, that there are few, I think, who will object to
seeing some stanzas of them here.</p>

<p>On a scrap of paper, in his handwriting, dated April 14. 1816, I find
the following list of his attendants, with an annexed outline of his
projected tour:&mdash;"<i>Servants</i>, &mdash;&mdash; Berger, a Swiss, William Fletcher,
and Robert Rushton.&mdash;John William Polidori, M.D.&mdash;Switzerland, Flanders,
Italy, and (perhaps) France." The two English servants, it will be
observed, were the same "yeoman" and "page" who had set out with him on
his youthful travels in 1809; and now,&mdash;for the second and last time
taking leave of his country,&mdash;on the 25th of April he sailed for Ostend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>Pg 239</span>The circumstances under which Lord Byron now took leave of England were
such as, in the case of any ordinary person, could not be considered
otherwise than disastrous and humiliating. He had, in the course of one
short year, gone through every variety of domestic misery;&mdash;had seen his
hearth eight or nine times profaned by the visitations of the law, and
been only saved from a prison by the privileges of his rank. He had
alienated, as far as they had ever been his, the affections of his wife;
and now, rejected by her, and condemned by the world, was betaking
himself to an exile which had not even the dignity of appearing
voluntary, as the excommunicating voice of society seemed to leave him
no other resource. Had he been of that class of unfeeling and
self-satisfied natures from whose hard surface the reproaches of others
fall pointless, he might have found in insensibility a sure refuge
against reproach; but, on the contrary, the same sensitiveness that kept
him so awake to the applauses of mankind, rendered him, in a still more
intense degree, alive to their censure. Even the strange, perverse
pleasure which he felt in painting himself unamiably to the world did
not prevent him from being both startled and pained when the world took
him at his word; and, like a child in a mask before a looking-glass, the
dark semblance which he had, half in sport, put on, when reflected back
upon him from the mirror of public opinion, shocked even himself.</p>

<p>Thus surrounded by vexations, and thus deeply feeling them, it is not
too much to say, that any<span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>Pg 240</span> other spirit but his own would have sunk
under the struggle, and lost, perhaps irrecoverably, that level of
self-esteem which alone affords a stand against the shocks of fortune.
But in him,&mdash;furnished as was his mind with reserves of strength,
waiting to be called out,&mdash;the very intensity of the pressure brought
relief by the proportionate re-action which it produced. Had his
transgressions and frailties been visited with no more than their due
portion of punishment, there can be little doubt that a very different
result would have ensued. Not only would such an excitement have been
insufficient to waken up the new energies still dormant in him, but that
consciousness of his own errors, which was for ever livelily present in
his mind, would, under such circumstances, have been left, undisturbed
by any unjust provocation, to work its usual softening and, perhaps,
humbling influences on his spirit. But,&mdash;luckily, as it proved, for the
further triumphs of his genius,&mdash;no such moderation was exercised. The
storm of invective raised around him, so utterly out of proportion with
his offences, and the base calumnies that were every where heaped upon
his name, left to his wounded pride no other resource than in the same
summoning up of strength, the same instinct of resistance to injustice,
which had first forced out the energies of his youthful genius, and was
now destined to give a still bolder and loftier range to its powers.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, not without truth, said of him by Goethe, that he was
inspired by the Genius of Pain; for, from the first to the last of his
agitated career,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241"></a>Pg 241</span> every fresh recruitment of his faculties was imbibed
from that bitter source. His chief incentive, when a boy, to distinction
was, as we have seen, that mark of deformity on his person, by an acute
sense of which he was first stung into the ambition of being great.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
As, with an evident reference to his own fate, he himself describes the
feeling,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"Deformity is daring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is its essence to o'ertake mankind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By heart and soul, and make itself the equal,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ay, the superior of the rest. There is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spur in its halt movements, to become<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that the others cannot, in such things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As still are free to both, to compensate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For stepdame Nature's avarice at first."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then came the disappointment of his youthful passion,&mdash;the lassitude and
remorse of premature excess,&mdash;the lone friendlessness of his entrance
into life, and the ruthless assault upon his first literary
efforts,&mdash;all links in that chain of trials, errors, and sufferings, by
which his great mind was gradually and painfully drawn out;&mdash;all bearing
their respective shares in accomplishing that destiny which seems to
have decreed that the triumphal march of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>Pg 242</span>his genius should be over the
waste and ruins of his heart. He appeared, indeed, himself to have had
an instinctive consciousness that it was out of such ordeals his
strength and glory were to arise, as his whole life was passed in
courting agitation and difficulties; and whenever the scenes around him
were too tame to furnish such excitement, he flew to fancy or memory for
"thorns" whereon to "lean his breast."</p>

<p>But the greatest of his trials, as well as triumphs, was yet to come.
The last stage of this painful, though glorious, course, in which fresh
power was, at every step, wrung from out his soul, was that at which we
are now arrived, his marriage and its results,&mdash;without which, dear as
was the price paid by him in peace and character, his career would have
been incomplete, and the world still left in ignorance of the full
compass of his genius. It is, indeed, worthy of remark, that it was not
till his domestic circumstances began to darken around him that his
fancy, which had long been idle, again rose upon the wing,&mdash;both The
Siege of Corinth and Parisina having been produced but a short time
before the separation. How conscious he was, too, that the turmoil which
followed was the true element of his restless spirit, may be collected
from several passages of his letters at that period, in one of which he
even mentions that his health had become all the better for the
conflict:&mdash;"It is odd," he says, "but agitation or contest of any kind
gives a rebound to my spirits, and sets me up for the time."</p>

<p>This buoyancy it was,&mdash;this irrepressible spring<span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243"></a>Pg 243</span> of mind,&mdash;that now
enabled him to bear up not only against the assaults of others, but,
what was still more difficult, against his own thoughts and feelings.
The muster of all his mental resources to which, in self-defence, he had
been driven, but opened to him the yet undreamed extent and capacity of
his powers, and inspired him with a proud confidence that he should yet
shine down these calumnious mists, convert censure to wonder, and compel
even those who could not approve to admire.</p>

<p>The route which he now took, through Flanders and by the Rhine, is best
traced in his own matchless verses, which leave a portion of their glory
on all that they touch, and lend to scenes, already clothed with
immortality by nature and by history, the no less durable associations
of undying song. On his leaving Brussels, an incident occurred which
would be hardly worth relating, were it not for the proof it affords of
the malicious assiduity with which every thing to his disadvantage was
now caught up and circulated in England. Mr. Pryce Gordon, a gentleman,
who appears to have seen a good deal of him during his short stay at
Brussels, thus relates the anecdote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lord Byron travelled in a huge coach, copied from the celebrated one of
Napoleon, taken at Genappe, with additions. Besides a <i>lit de repos</i>, it
contained a library, a plate-chest, and every apparatus for dining in
it. It was not, however, found sufficiently capacious for his baggage
and suite; and he purchased a cal&egrave;che at Brussels for his servants. It
broke down going to Waterloo, and I advised him<span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>Pg 244</span> to return it, as it
seemed to be a crazy machine; but as he had made a deposit of forty
Napoleons (certainly double its value), the honest Fleming would not
consent to restore the cash, or take back his packing case, except under
a forfeiture of thirty Napoleons. As his Lordship was to set out the
following day, he begged me to make the best arrangement I could in the
affair. He had no sooner taken his departure, than the worthy <i>sellier</i>
inserted a paragraph in 'The Brussels Oracle,' stating 'that the noble
<i>milor Anglais</i> had absconded with his cal&egrave;che, value 1800 francs!'"</p>

<p>In the Courier of May 13., the Brussels account of this transaction is
thus copied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The following is an extract from the Dutch Mail, dated Brussels, May
8th,:&mdash;In the Journal de Belgique, of this date, is a petition from a
coachmaker at Brussels to the president of the Tribunal de Premier
Instance, stating that he has sold to Lord Byron a carriage, &amp;c. for
1882 francs, of which he has received 847 francs, but that his Lordship,
who is going away the same day, refuses to pay him the remaining 1035
francs; he begs permission to seize the carriage, &amp;c. This being granted,
he put it into the hands of a proper officer, who went to signify the
above to Lord Byron, and was informed by the landlord of the hotel that
his Lordship was gone without having given him any thing to pay the
debt, on which the officer seized a chaise belonging to his Lordship as
security for the amount."</p>

<p>It was not till the beginning of the following month that a
contradiction of this falsehood, stating<span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245"></a>Pg 245</span> the real circumstances of the
case, as above related, was communicated to the Morning Chronicle, in a
letter from Brussels, signed "Pryce L. Gordon."</p>

<p>Another anecdote, of far more interest, has been furnished from the same
respectable source. It appears that the two first stanzas of the verses
relating to Waterloo, "Stop, for thy tread is on an empire's dust<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>,"
were written at Brussels, after a visit to that memorable field, and
transcribed by Lord Byron, next morning, in an album belonging to the
lady of the gentleman who communicates the anecdote.</p>

<p>"A few weeks after he had written them (says the relater), the
well-known artist, R.R. Reinagle, a friend of mine, arrived in Brussels,
when I invited him to dine with me and showed him the lines, requesting
him to embellish them with an appropriate vignette to the following
passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"'Here his last flight the haughty eagle flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then tore, with bloody beak, the fatal plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pierced with the shafts of banded nations through,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ambition's life, and labours, all were vain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wears the shatter'd links of the world's broken chain.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Reinagle sketched with a pencil a spirited chained eagle, grasping
the earth with his talons.</p>

<p>"I had occasion to write to his Lordship, and mentioned having got this
clever artist to draw a vignette to his beautiful lines, and the liberty
he had taken <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>Pg 246</span>by altering the action of the eagle. In reply to this, he
wrote to me,&mdash;'Reinagle is a better poet and a better ornithologist than
I am; eagles, and all birds of prey, attack with their talons, and not
with their beaks, and I have altered the line thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Then tore, with bloody talon, the rent plain.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is, I think, a better line, besides its poetical justice.' I need
hardly add, when I communicated this flattering compliment to the
painter, that he was highly gratified."</p>

<p>From Brussels the noble traveller pursued his course along the Rhine,&mdash;a
line of road which he has strewed over with all the riches of poesy;
and, arriving at Geneva, took up his abode at the well-known hotel,
S&eacute;cheron. After a stay of a few weeks at this place, he removed to a
villa, in the neighbourhood, called Diodati, very beautifully situated
on the high banks of the Lake, where he established his residence for
the remainder of the summer.</p>

<p>I shall now give the few letters in my possession written by him at this
time, and then subjoin to them such anecdotes as I have been able to
collect relative to the same period.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 242. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ouchy, near Lausanne, June 27. 1816.</p>

<p>"I am thus far (kept by stress of weather) on my way back to
Diodati (near Geneva) from a voyage in my boat round the Lake; and
I enclose you a sprig of <i>Gibbons acacia</i> and some rose-leaves from
his garden, which, with part of his house, I have just seen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>Pg 247</span> You
will find honourable mention, in his Life, made of this 'acacia,'
when he walked out on the night of concluding his history. The
garden and <i>summer-house</i>, where he composed, are neglected, and
the last utterly decayed; but they still show it as his 'cabinet,'
and seem perfectly aware of his memory.</p>

<p>"My route, through Flanders, and by the Rhine, to Switzerland, was
all I expected, and more.</p>

<p>"I have traversed all Rousseau's ground with the Heloise before me,
and am struck to a degree that I cannot express with the force and
accuracy of his descriptions and the beauty of their reality.
Meillerie, Clarens, and Vevay, and the Ch&acirc;teau de Chillon, are
places of which I shall say little, because all I could say must
fall short of the impressions they stamp.</p>

<p>"Three days ago, we were most nearly wrecked in a squall off
Meillerie, and driven to shore. I ran no risk, being so near the
rocks, and a good swimmer; but our party were wet, and incommoded a
good deal. The wind was strong enough to blow down some trees, as
we found at landing: however, all is righted and right, and we are
thus far on our return.</p>

<p>"Dr. Polidori is not here, but at Diodati, left behind in hospital
with a sprained ankle, which he acquired in tumbling from a
wall&mdash;he can't jump.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to hear you are well, and have received for me
certain helms and swords, sent from Waterloo, which I rode over
with pain and pleasure.</p>

<p>"I have finished a third canto of Childe Harold (consisting of one
hundred and seventeen stanzas),<span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>Pg 248</span> longer than either of the two
former, and in some parts, it may be, better; but of course on that
I cannot determine. I shall send it by the first safe-looking
opportunity. Ever," &amp;c.</p></div>

advertisement<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>, which was copied by Dr. Polidori, and which
appears to be about the most impudent imposition that ever issued
from Grub Street. I need hardly say that I know nothing of all this
trash, nor whence it may spring,&mdash;'Odes to St. Helena,'&mdash;'Farewells
to England,' &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;and if it can be disavowed, or is worth
disavowing, you have full authority to do so. I never wrote, nor
conceived, a line on any thing of the kind, any more than of two
other things with which I was saddled&mdash;something about 'Gaul,' and
another about 'Mrs. La Valette;' and as to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>Pg 249</span>'Lily of France,' I
should as soon think of celebrating a turnip. 'On the Morning of my
Daughter's Birth,' I had other things to think of than verses; and
should never have dreamed of such an invention, till Mr. Johnston
and his pamphlet's advertisement broke in upon me with a new light
on the crafts and subtleties of the demon of printing,&mdash;or rather
publishing.</p>

<p>"I did hope that some succeeding lie would have superseded the
thousand and one which were accumulated during last winter. I can
forgive whatever may be said of or against me, but not what they
make me say or sing for myself. It is enough to answer for what I
have written; but it were too much for Job himself to bear what one
has not. I suspect that when the Arab Patriarch wished that his
'enemy had written a book,' he did not anticipate his own name on
the title-page. I feel quite as much bored with this foolery as it
deserves, and more than I should be if I had not a headach.</p>

<p>"Of Glenarvon, Madame de Sta&euml;l told me (ten days ago, at Copet)
marvellous and grievous things; but I have seen nothing of it but
the motto, which promises amiably 'for us and for our tragedy.' If
such be the posy, what should the ring be? 'a name to all
succeeding<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>,' &amp;c. The generous moment selected for the
publication is probably its kindest accompaniment, and&mdash;truth to
say&mdash;the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>Pg 250</span>time <i>was</i> well chosen. I have not even a guess at the
contents, except from the very vague accounts I have heard.</p>

<p>"I ought to be ashamed of the egotism of this letter. It is not my
fault altogether, and I shall be but too happy to drop the subject
when others will allow me.</p>

<p>"I am in tolerable plight, and in my last letter told you what I
had done in the way of all rhyme. I trust that you prosper, and
that your authors are in good condition. I should suppose your stud
has received some increase by what I hear. Bertram must be a good
horse; does he run next meeting? I hope you will beat the Row.
Yours alway," &amp;c.</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER 244. TO MR. ROGERS.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Diodati, near Geneva, July 29. 1816.</p>

<p>"Do you recollect a book, Mathieson's Letters, which you lent me,
which I have still, and yet hope to return to your library? Well, I
have encountered at Copet and elsewhere Gray's correspondent, that
same Bonstetten, to whom I lent the translation of his
correspondent's epistles, for a few days; but all he could remember
of Gray amounts to little, except that he was the most 'melancholy
and gentlemanlike' of all possible poets. Bonstetten himself is a
fine and very lively old man, and much esteemed by his compatriots;
he is also a <i>litt&eacute;rateur</i> of good repute, and all his friends have
a mania of addressing to him volumes of letters&mdash;Mathieson, Muller
the historian, &amp;c.&amp;c. He is a good deal at Copet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>Pg 251</span> where I have met
him a few times. All there are well, except Rocca, who, I am sorry
to say, looks in a very bad state of health. Schlegel is in high
force, and Madame as brilliant as ever.</p>

<p>"I came here by the Netherlands and the Rhine route, and Basle,
Berne, Moral, and Lausanne. I have circumnavigated the Lake, and go
to Chamouni with the first fair weather; but really we have had
lately such stupid mists, fogs, and perpetual density, that one
would think Castlereagh had the Foreign Affairs of the kingdom of
Heaven also on his hands. I need say nothing to you of these parts,
you having traversed them already. I do not think of Italy before
September. I have read Glenarvon, and have also seen Ben.
Constant's Adolphe, and his preface, denying the real people. It is
a work which leaves an unpleasant impression, but very consistent
with the consequences of not being in love, which is, perhaps, as
disagreeable as any thing, except being so. I doubt, however,
whether all such <i>liens</i> (as he calls them) terminate so wretchedly
as his hero and heroine's.</p>

<p>"There is a third Canto (a longer than either of the former) of
Childe Harold finished, and some smaller things,&mdash;among them a
story on the Ch&acirc;teau de Chillon; I only wait a good opportunity to
transmit them to the grand Murray, who, I hope, flourishes. Where
is Moore? Why is he not out? My love to him, and my perfect
consideration and remembrances to all, particularly to Lord and
Lady Holland, and to your Duchess of Somerset.</p>

<p>"I am very much flattered by Mr. Gifford's good opinion of the
MSS., and shall be still more so if it answers your expectations
and justifies his kindness. I liked it myself, but that must go for
nothing. The feelings with which most of it was written need not be
envied me. With regard to the price, <i>I</i> fixed <i>none</i>, but left it
to Mr. Kinnaird, Mr. Shelley, and yourself, to arrange. Of course,
they would do their best; and as to yourself, I knew you would make
no difficulties. But I agree with Mr. Kinnaird perfectly, that the
concluding <i>five hundred</i> should be only <i>conditional</i>; and for my
own sake, I wish it to be added, only in case of your selling a
certain number, <i>that number</i> to be fixed by <i>yourself</i>. I hope
this is fair. In every thing of this kind there must be risk; and
till that be past, in one way or the other, I would not willingly
add to it, particularly in times like the present. And pray always
recollect that nothing could mortify me more&mdash;no failure on my own
part&mdash;than having made you lose by any purchase from me.</p>

<p>"The Monody<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> was written by request of Mr. Kinnaird for the
theatre. I did as well as I could;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253"></a>Pg 253</span> but where I have not my choice
I pretend to answer for nothing. Mr. Hobhouse and myself are just
returned from a journey of lakes and mountains. We have been to the
Grindelwald, and the Jungfrau, and stood on the summit of the
Wengen Alp; and seen torrents of nine hundred feet in fall, and
glaciers of all dimensions: we have heard shepherds' pipes, and
avalanches, and looked on the clouds foaming up from the valleys
below us, like the spray of the ocean of hell. Chamouni, and that
which it inherits, we saw a month ago: but though Mont Blanc is
higher, it is not equal in wildness to the Jungfrau, the Eighers,
the Shreckhorn, and the Rose Glaciers.</p>

<p>"We set off for Italy next week. The road is within this month
infested with bandits, but we must take our chance and such
precautions as are requisite.</p>

<p>"Ever, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. My best remembrances to Mr. Gifford. Pray say all that can be
said from me to him.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that Mr. Maturin did not like Phillips's picture. I
thought it was reckoned a good one. If he had made the speech on
the original, perhaps he would have been more readily forgiven by
the proprietor and the painter of the portrait * * *."</p></div>

<p>"I answered your obliging letters yesterday: to-day the Monody
arrived with its <i>title</i>-page, which is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>Pg 254</span> I presume, a separate

<p>I will request you to expunge that same, unless you please to add,
'by a person of quality,' or 'of wit and honour about town.' Merely
say, 'written to be spoken at Drury Lane.' To-morrow I dine at
Copet. Saturday I strike tents for Italy. This evening, on the lake
in my boat with Mr. Hobhouse, the pole which sustains the mainsail
slipped in tacking, and struck me so violently on one of my legs
(the <i>worst</i>, luckily) as to make me do a foolish thing, viz. to
<i>faint</i>&mdash;a downright swoon; the thing must have jarred some nerve
or other, for the bone is not injured, and hardly painful (it is
six hours since), and cost Mr. Hobhouse some apprehension and much
sprinkling of water to recover me. The sensation was a very odd
one: I never had but two such before, once from a cut on the head
from a stone, several years ago, and once (long ago also) in
falling into a great wreath of snow;&mdash;a sort of grey giddiness
first, then nothingness, and a total loss of memory on beginning to
recover. The last part is not disagreeable, if one did not find it
again.</p>

<p>"You want the original MSS. Mr. Davies has the first fair copy in
my own hand, and I have the rough composition here, and will send
or save it for you, since you wish it.</p>

send you what I can. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>Pg 255</span> present I must lay by a little, having
pretty well exhausted myself in what I have sent you. Italy or
Dalmatia and another summer may, or may not, set me off again. I
have no plans, and am nearly as indifferent what may come as where
I go. I shall take Felicia Heman's Restoration, &amp;c. with me; it is
a good poem&mdash;very.</p>

you the accident for want of better to say; but it is over, and I
am only wondering what the deuce was the matter with me.</p>

<p>"I have lately been over all the Bernese Alps and their lakes. I
think many of the scenes (some of which were not those usually
frequented by the English) finer than Chamouni, which I visited
some time before. I have been to Clarens again, and crossed the
mountains behind it: of this tour I kept a short journal for my

<p>From the Journal mentioned in the foregoing letter, I am enabled to give
the following extracts:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>EXTRACTS FROM A JOURNAL.</b></p>

<p>"September 18. 1816.</p>

<p>"Yesterday, September 17th, I set out with Mr. Hobhouse on an excursion
of some days to the mountains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"September 17.</p>

<p>"Rose at five; left Diodati about seven, in one of the country carriages
(a char-&agrave;-banc), our servants on horseback. Weather very fine; the lake
calm and clear; Mont Blanc and the Aiguille of Argenti&egrave;res both very
distinct; the borders of the lake beautiful. Reached Lausanne before
sunset; stopped and slept at &mdash;&mdash;. Went to bed at nine: slept till five
o'clock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"September 18.</p>

<p>"Called by my courier; got up. Hobhouse walked on before. A mile from
Lausanne, the road overflowed by the lake; got on horseback and rode
till within a mile of Vevay. The colt young, but went very well.
Overtook Hobhouse, and resumed the carriage, which is an open one.
Stopped at Vevay two hours (the second time I had visited it); walked to
the church; view from the churchyard superb; within it General Ludlow
(the regicide's) monument&mdash;black marble&mdash;long inscription&mdash;Latin, but
simple; he was an exile two-and-thirty-years&mdash;one of King Charles's
judges. Near him Broughton (who read King Charles's sentence to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257"></a>Pg 257</span> Charles
Stuart) is buried, with a queer and rather canting, but still a
republican, inscription. Ludlow's house shown; it retains still its
inscription&mdash;'Omne solum forti patria.' Walked down to the Lake side;
servants, carriage, saddle-horses&mdash;all set off and left us <i>plant&eacute;s l&agrave;</i>,
by some mistake, and we walked on after them towards Clarens: Hobhouse
ran on before, and overtook them at last. Arrived the second time (first
time was by water) at Clarens. Went to Chillon through scenery worthy of
I know not whom; went over the Castle of Chillon again. On our return
met an English party in a carriage; a lady in it fast asleep&mdash;fast
asleep in the most anti-narcotic spot in the world&mdash;excellent! I
remember, at Chamouni, in the very eyes of Mont Blanc, hearing another
woman, English also, exclaim to her party, 'Did you ever see any thing
more <i>rural</i>?'&mdash;as if it was Highgate, or Hampstead, or Brompton, or
Hayes,&mdash;'Rural!' quotha.&mdash;Rocks, pines, torrents, glaciers, clouds, and
summits of eternal snow far above them&mdash;and 'rural!'</p>

<p>"After a slight and short dinner we visited the Chateau de Clarens; an
English woman has rented it recently (it was not let when I saw it
first); the roses are gone with their summer; the family out, but the
servants desired us to walk over the interior of the mansion. Saw on the
table of the saloon Blair's Sermons and somebody else's (I forget who's)
sermons, and a set of noisy children. Saw all worth seeing, and then
descended to the 'Bosquet de Julie,' &amp;c. &amp;c.; our guide full of
Rousseau, whom he is eternally confounding with St. Preux, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258"></a>Pg 258</span> mixing
the man and the book. Went again as far as Chillon to revisit the little
torrent from the hill behind it. Sunset reflected in the lake. Have to
get up at five to-morrow to cross the mountains on horseback; carriage
to be sent round; lodged at my old cottage&mdash;hospitable and comfortable;
tired with a longish ride on the colt, and the subsequent jolting of the
char-&agrave;-banc, and my scramble in the hot sun.</p>

<p>"Mem. The corporal who showed the wonders of Chillon was as drunk as
Blucher, and (to my mind) as great a man; he was deaf also, and thinking
every one else so, roared out the legends of the castle so fearfully
that H. got out of humour. However, we saw things from the gallows to
the dungeons (the <i>potence</i> and the <i>cachots</i>), and returned to Clarens
with more freedom than belonged to the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"September 19.</p>

<p>"Rose at five. Crossed the mountains to Montbovon on horseback, and on
mules, and, by dint of scrambling, on foot also; the whole route
beautiful as a dream, and now to me almost as indistinct. I am so
tired;&mdash;for though healthy, I have not the strength I possessed but a
few years ago. At Montbovon we breakfasted; afterwards, on a steep
ascent dismounted; tumbled down; cut a finger open; the baggage also got
loose and fell down a ravine, till stopped by a large tree; recovered
baggage; horse tired and drooping; mounted mule. At the approach of the
summit of Dent Jument<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> dismounted<span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259"></a>Pg 259</span> again with Hobhouse and all the
party. Arrived at a lake in the very bosom of the mountains; left our
quadrupeds with a shepherd, and ascended farther; came to some snow in
patches, upon which my forehead's perspiration fell like rain, making
the same dints as in a sieve; the chill of the wind and the snow turned
me giddy, but I scrambled on and upwards. Hobhouse went to the highest
pinnacle; I did not, but paused within a few yards (at an opening of the
cliff). In coming down, the guide tumbled three times; I fell a
laughing, and tumbled too&mdash;the descent luckily soft, though steep and
slippery: Hobhouse also fell, but nobody hurt. The whole of the
mountains superb. A shepherd on a very steep and high cliff playing upon
his <i>pipe</i>; very different from <i>Arcadia</i>, where I saw the pastors with
a long musket instead of a crook, and pistols in their girdles. Our
Swiss shepherd's pipe was sweet, and his tune agreeable. I saw a cow
strayed; am told that they often break their necks on and over the
crags. Descended to Montbovon; pretty scraggy village, with a wild river
and a wooden bridge. Hobhouse went to fish&mdash;caught one. Our carriage not
come; our horses, mules, &amp;c. knocked up; ourselves fatigued; but so much
the better&mdash;I shall sleep.</p>

<p>"The view from the highest points of to-day's journey comprised on one
side the greatest part of Lake Leman; on the other, the valleys and
mountain of the Canton of Fribourg, and an immense plain, with the lakes
of Neuch&acirc;tel and Morat, and all which the borders of the Lake of Geneva
inherit;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260"></a>Pg 260</span> we had both sides of the Jura before us in one point of view,
with Alps in plenty. In passing a ravine, the guide recommended
strenuously a quickening of pace, as the stones fall with great rapidity
and occasional damage; the advice is excellent, but, like most good
advice, impracticable, the road being so rough that neither mules, nor
mankind, nor horses, can make any violent progress. Passed without
fractures or menace thereof.</p>

<p>"The music of the cow's bells (for their wealth, like the patriarchs',
is cattle) in the pastures, which reach to a height far above any
mountains in Britain, and the shepherds shouting to us from crag to
crag, and playing on their reeds where the steeps appeared almost
inaccessible, with the surrounding scenery, realised all that I have
ever heard or imagined of a pastoral existence:&mdash;much more so than
Greece or Asia Minor, for there we are a little too much of the sabre
and musket order, and if there is a crook in one hand, you are sure to
see a gun in the other:&mdash;but this was pure and unmixed&mdash;solitary,
savage, and patriarchal. As we went, they played the 'Rans des Vaches'
and other airs, by way of farewell. I have lately repeopled my mind with
nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"September 20.</p>

<p>Up at six; off at eight. The whole of this day's journey at an average
of between from 2700 to 3000 feet above the level of the sea. This
valley, the longest, narrowest, and considered the finest of the Alps,
little traversed by travellers. Saw the bridge of La Roche. The bed of
the river very low and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261"></a>Pg 261</span> deep, between immense rocks, and rapid as
anger;&mdash;a man and mule said to have tumbled over without damage. The
people looked free, and happy, and <i>rich</i> (which last implies neither of
the former); the cows superb; a bull nearly leapt into the
char-&agrave;-banc&mdash;'agreeable companion in a post-chaise;' goats and sheep
very thriving. A mountain with enormous glaciers to the right&mdash;the
Klitzgerberg; further on, the Hockthorn&mdash;nice names&mdash;so
soft!&mdash;<i>Stockhorn</i>, I believe, very lofty and scraggy, patched with snow
only; no glaciers on it, but some good epaulettes of clouds.</p>

<p>"Passed the boundaries, out of Vaud and into Berne canton; French
exchanged for bad German; the district famous for cheese, liberty,
property, and no taxes. Hobhouse went to fish&mdash;caught none. Strolled to
the river; saw boy and kid; kid followed him like a dog; kid could not
get over a fence, and bleated piteously; tried myself to help kid, but
nearly overset both self and kid into the river. Arrived here about six
in the evening. Nine o'clock&mdash;going to bed; not tired to day, but hope
to sleep, nevertheless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"September 21.</p>

<p>"Off early. The valley of Simmenthal as before. Entrance to the plain of
Thoun very narrow; high rocks, wooded to the top; river; new mountains,
with fine glaciers. Lake of Thoun; extensive plain with a girdle of
Alps. Walked down to the Chateau de Schadau; view along the lake;
crossed the river in a boat rowed by women. Thoun a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>Pg 262</span> pretty town.
The whole day's journey Alpine and proud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"September 22.</p>

<p>"Left Thoun in a boat, which carried us the length of the lake in three
hours. The lake small; but the banks fine. Rocks down to the water's
edge. Landed at Newhause; passed Interlachen; entered upon a range of
scenes beyond all description or previous conception. Passed a rock;
inscription&mdash;two brothers&mdash;one murdered the other; just the place for
it. After a variety of windings came to an enormous rock. Arrived at the
foot of the mountain (the Jungfrau, that is, the Maiden); glaciers;
torrents; one of these torrents <i>nine hundred feet</i> in height of visible
descent. Lodged at the curate's. Set out to see the valley; heard an
avalanche fall, like thunder; glaciers enormous; storm came on, thunder,
lightning, hail; all in perfection, and beautiful. I was on horseback;
guide wanted to carry my cane; I was going to give it him, when I
recollected that it was a sword-stick, and I thought the lightning might
be attracted towards him; kept it myself; a good deal encumbered with
it, as it was too heavy for a whip, and the horse was stupid, and stood
with every other peal. Got in, not very wet, the cloak being stanch.
Hobhouse wet through; Hobhouse took refuge in cottage; sent man,
umbrella, and cloak (from the curate's when I arrived) after him. Swiss
curate's house very good indeed&mdash;much better than most English
vicarages. It is immediately opposite the torrent I spoke of. The
torrent is in shape curving over the rock, like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263"></a>Pg 263</span> <i>tail</i> of a white
horse streaming in the wind, such as it might be conceived would be that
of the 'pale horse' on which Death is mounted in the Apocalypse.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> It
is neither mist nor water, but a something between both; its immense
height (nine hundred feet) gives it a wave or curve, a spreading here or
condensation there, wonderful and indescribable. I think, upon the
whole, that this day has been better than any of this present excursion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"September 23.</p>

<p>"Before ascending the mountain, went to the torrent (seven in the
morning) again; the sun upon it, forming a <i>rainbow</i> of the lower part
of all colours, but principally purple and gold; the bow moving as you
move; I never saw any thing like this; it is only in the sunshine.
Ascended the Wengen mountain; at noon reached a valley on the summit;
left the horses, took off my coat, and went to the summit, seven
thousand feet (English feet) above the level of the <i>sea</i>, and about
five thousand above the valley <span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264"></a>Pg 264</span>we left in the morning. On one side, our
view comprised the Jungfrau, with all her glaciers; then the Dent
d'Argent, shining like truth; then the Little Giant (the Kleine Eigher);
and the Great Giant (the Grosse Eigher), and last, not least, the
Wetterhorn. The height of Jungfrau is 13,000 feet above the sea, 11,000
above the valley; she is the highest of this range. Heard the avalanches
falling every five minutes nearly. From whence we stood, on the Wengen
Alp, we had all these in view on one side; on the other, the clouds rose
from the opposite valley, curling up perpendicular precipices like the
foam of the ocean of hell, during a spring tide&mdash;it was white, and
sulphury, and immeasurably deep in appearance.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The side we ascended
was (of course) not of so precipitous a nature; but on arriving at the
summit, we looked down upon the other side upon a boiling sea of cloud,
dashing against the crags on which we stood (these crags on one side
quite perpendicular). Stayed a quarter of an hour; begun to descend;
quite clear from cloud on that side of the mountain. In passing the
masses of snow, I made a snowball and pelted Hobhouse with it.</p>

<p>"Got down to our horses again; ate something;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265"></a>Pg 265</span> remounted; heard the
avalanches still; came to a morass; Hobhouse dismounted to get over
well; I tried to pass my horse over; the horse sunk up to the chin, and
of course he and I were in the mud together; bemired, but not hurt;
laughed, and rode on. Arrived at the Grindelwald; dined; mounted again,
and rode to the higher glacier&mdash;like <i>a frozen hurricane</i>.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
Starlight, beautiful, but a devil of a path! Never mind, got safe in; a
little lightning; but the whole of the day as fine in point of weather
as the day on which Paradise was made. Passed <i>whole woods of withered
pines, all withered</i>; trunks stripped and barkless, branches lifeless;
done by a single winter<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>,&mdash;their appearance reminded me of me and my
family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"September 24.</p>

<p>"Set off at seven; up at five. Passed the black glacier, the mountain
Wetterhorn on the right; crossed the Scheideck mountain; came to the
<i>Rose</i> glacier, said to be the largest and finest in Switzerland, <i>I</i>
think the Bossons glacier at Chamouni as fine; Hobhouse does not. Came
to the Reichenbach waterfall, two hundred feet high; halted to rest the
horses. Arrived in the valley of Overland; rain came on; drenched a
little; only four hours' rain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>Pg 266</span> however, in eight days. Came to the lake
of Brientz, then to the town of Brientz; changed. In the evening, four
Swiss peasant girls of Oberhasli came and sang the airs of their
country; two of the voices beautiful&mdash;the tunes also: so wild and
original, and at the same time of great sweetness. The singing is over;
but below stairs I hear the notes of a fiddle, which bode no good to my
night's rest; I shall go down and see the dancing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"September 25.</p>

<p>"The whole town of Brientz were apparently gathered together in the
rooms below; pretty music and excellent waltzing; none but peasants; the
dancing much better than in England; the English can't waltz, never
could, never will. One man with his pipe in his mouth, but danced as
well as the others; some other dances in pairs and in fours, and very
good. I went to bed, but the revelry continued below late and early.
Brientz but a village. Rose early. Embarked on the lake of Brientz,
rowed by the women in a long boat; presently we put to shore, and
another woman jumped in. It seems it is the custom here for the boats to
be <i>manned</i> by <i>women</i>: for of five men and three women in our bark, all
the women took an oar, and but one man.</p>

<p>"Got to Interlachen in three hours; pretty lake; not so large as that of
Thoun. Dined at Interlachen. Girl gave me some flowers, and made me a
speech in German, of which I know nothing; I do not know whether the
speech was pretty, but as the woman was, I hope so. Re-embarked on the
lake of Thoun;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267"></a>Pg 267</span> fell asleep part of the way; sent our horses round;
found people on the shore, blowing up a rock with gunpowder; they blew
it up near our boat, only telling us a minute before;&mdash;mere stupidity,
but they might have broken our noddles. Got to Thoun in the evening; the
weather has been tolerable the whole day. But as the wild part of our
tour is finished, it don't matter to us; in all the desirable part, we
have been most lucky in warmth and clearness of atmosphere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"September 26.</p>

<p>"Being out of the mountains, my journal must be as flat as my journey.
From Thoun to Berne, good road, hedges, villages, industry, property,
and all sorts of tokens of insipid civilisation. From Berne to Fribourg;
different canton; Catholics; passed a field of battle; Swiss beat the
French in one of the late wars against the French republic. Bought a
dog. The greater part of this tour has been on horseback, on foot, and
on mule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"September 28.</p>

<p>"Saw the tree planted in honour of the battle of Morat; three hundred
and forty years old; a good deal decayed. Left Fribourg, but first saw
the cathedral; high tower. Overtook the baggage of the nuns of La
Trappe, who are removing to Normandy; afterwards a coach, with a
quantity of nuns in it. Proceeded along the banks of the lake of
Neuch&acirc;tel; very pleasing and soft, but not so mountainous&mdash;at least, the
Jura, not appearing so, after the Bernese Alps. Reached Yverdun in the
dusk; a long line of large trees on the border of the lake; fine and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268"></a>Pg 268</span>
sombre; the auberge nearly full&mdash;a German princess and suite; got rooms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"September 29.</p>

<p>"Passed through a fine and flourishing country, but not mountainous. In
the evening reached Aubonne (the entrance and bridge something like that
of Durham), which commands by far the fairest view of the Lake of
Geneva; twilight; the moon on the lake; a grove on the height, and of
very noble trees. Here Tavernier (the eastern traveller) bought (or
built) the ch&acirc;teau, because the site resembled and equalled that of
<i>Erivan</i>, a frontier city of Persia; here he finished his voyages, and I
this little excursion,&mdash;for I am within a few hours of Diodati, and have
little more to see, and no more to say."</p>

<p>With the following melancholy passage this Journal concludes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the weather for this tour (of 13 days), I have been very
fortunate&mdash;fortunate in a companion (Mr. H.)&mdash;fortunate in our
prospects, and exempt from even the little petty accidents and delays
which often render journeys in a less wild country disappointing. I was
disposed to be pleased. I am a lover of nature and an admirer of beauty.
I can bear fatigue and welcome privation, and have seen some of the
noblest views in the world. But in all this&mdash;the recollection of
bitterness, and more especially of recent and more home desolation,
which must accompany me through life, have preyed upon me here; and
neither the music of the shepherd,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269"></a>Pg 269</span> the crashing of the avalanche, nor
the torrent, the mountain, the glacier, the forest, nor the cloud, have
for one moment lightened the weight upon my heart, nor enabled me to
lose my own wretched identity in the majesty, and the power, and the
glory, around, above, and beneath me."</p>

<p>Among the inmates at S&eacute;cheron, on his arrival at Geneva, Lord Byron had
found Mr. and Mrs. Shelley, and a female relative of the latter, who had
about a fortnight before taken up their residence at this hotel. It was
the first time that Lord Byron and Mr. Shelley ever met; though, long
before, when the latter was quite a youth,&mdash;being the younger of the two
by four or five years,&mdash;he had sent to the noble poet a copy of his
Queen Mab, accompanied by a letter, in which, after detailing at full
length all the accusations he had heard brought against his character,
he added, that, should these charges not have been true, it would make
him happy to be honoured with his acquaintance. The book alone, it
appears, reached its destination,&mdash;the letter having miscarried,&mdash;and
Lord Byron was known to have expressed warm admiration of the opening
lines of the poem.</p>

<p>There was, therefore, on their present meeting at Geneva, no want of
disposition towards acquaintance on either side, and an intimacy almost
immediately sprung up between them. Among the tastes common to both,
that for boating was not the least strong; and in this beautiful region
they had more than ordinary temptations to indulge in it. Every evening,
during their residence under the same roof at S&eacute;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270"></a>Pg 270</span>cheron, they embarked,
accompanied by the ladies and Polidori, on the Lake; and to the feelings
and fancies inspired by these excursions, which were not unfrequently
prolonged into the hours of moonlight, we are indebted for some of those
enchanting stanzas<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> in which the poet has given way to his
passionate love of Nature so fervidly.</p>

</div></div>

<p>A person who was of these parties has thus described to me one of their
evenings:&mdash;"When the <i>bise</i> or north-east wind blows, the waters of the
Lake are driven towards the town, and with the stream of the Rhone,
which sets strongly in the same direction, combine to make a very rapid
current towards the harbour. Carelessly, one evening, we had yielded to
its course, till we found ourselves almost driven on the piles; and it
required all our rowers' strength to master the tide. The waves were
high and inspiriting&mdash;we were all animated by our contest with the
elements. 'I will sing you an Albanian song,' cried Lord Byron; 'now, be
sentimental and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>Pg 271</span> give me all your attention.' It was a strange, wild
howl that he gave forth; but such as, he declared, was an exact
imitation of the savage Albanian mode,&mdash;laughing, the while, at our
disappointment, who had expected a wild Eastern melody."</p>

<p>Sometimes the party landed, for a walk upon the shore, and, on such
occasions, Lord Byron would loiter behind the rest, lazily trailing his
sword-stick along, and moulding, as he went, his thronging thoughts into
shape. Often too, when in the boat, he would lean abstractedly over the
side, and surrender himself up, in silence, to the same absorbing task.</p>

<p>The conversation of Mr. Shelley, from the extent of his poetic reading,
and the strange, mystic speculations into which his system of philosophy
led him, was of a nature strongly to arrest and interest the attention
of Lord Byron, and to turn him away from worldly associations and topics
into more abstract and untrodden ways of thought. As far as contrast,
indeed, is an enlivening ingredient of such intercourse, it would be
difficult to find two persons more formed to whet each other's faculties
by discussion, as on few points of common interest between them did
their opinions agree; and that this difference had its root deep in the
conformation of their respective minds needs but a glance through the
rich, glittering labyrinth of Mr. Shelley's pages to assure us.</p>

<p>In Lord Byron, the real was never forgotten in the fanciful. However
Imagination had placed her whole realm at his disposal, he was no less a
man of this world than a ruler of hers; and, accordingly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272"></a>Pg 272</span> through the
airiest and most subtile creations of his brain still the life-blood of
truth and reality circulates. With Shelley it was far otherwise;&mdash;his
fancy (and he had sufficient for a whole generation of poets) was the
medium through which he saw all things, his facts as well as his
theories; and not only the greater part of his poetry, but the political
and philosophical speculations in which he indulged, were all distilled
through the same over-refining and unrealising alembic. Having started
as a teacher and reformer of the world, at an age when he could know
nothing of the world but from fancy, the persecution he met with on the
threshold of this boyish enterprise but confirmed him in his first
paradoxical views of human ills and their remedies; and, instead of
waiting to take lessons of authority and experience, he, with a courage,
admirable had it been but wisely directed, made war upon both. From this
sort of self-willed start in the world, an impulse was at once given to
his opinions and powers directly contrary, it would seem, to their
natural bias, and from which his life was too short to allow him time to
recover. With a mind, by nature, fervidly pious, he yet refused to
acknowledge a Supreme Providence, and substituted some airy abstraction
of "Universal Love" in its place. An aristocrat by birth and, as I
understand, also in appearance and manners, he was yet a leveller in
politics, and to such an Utopian extent as to be, seriously, the
advocate of a community of property. With a delicacy and even romance of
sentiment, which lends such grace to some of his lesser poems,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>Pg 273</span> he could
notwithstanding contemplate a change in the relations of the sexes,
which would have led to results fully as gross as his arguments for it
were fastidious and refined; and though benevolent and generous to an
extent that seemed to exclude all idea of selfishness, he yet scrupled
not, in the pride of system, to disturb wantonly the faith of his
fellowmen, and, without substituting any equivalent good in its place,
to rob the wretched of a hope, which, even if false, would be worth all
this world's best truths.</p>

<p>Upon no point were the opposite tendencies of the two friends,&mdash;to
long-established opinions and matter of fact on one side, and to all
that was most innovating and visionary on the other,&mdash;more observable
than in their notions on philosophical subjects; Lord Byron being, with
the great bulk of mankind, a believer in the existence of Matter and
Evil, while Shelley so far refined upon the theory of Berkeley as not
only to resolve the whole of Creation into spirit, but to add also to
this immaterial system some pervading principle, some abstract
non-entity of Love and Beauty, of which&mdash;as a substitute, at least, for
Deity&mdash;the philosophic bishop had never dreamed. On such subjects, and
on poetry, their conversation generally turned; and, as might be
expected, from Lord Byron's facility in receiving new impressions, the
opinions of his companion were not altogether without some influence on
his mind. Here and there, among those fine bursts of passion and
description that abound in the third Canto of Childe Harold, may be
discovered traces of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274"></a>Pg 274</span> that mysticism of meaning,&mdash;that sublimity, losing
itself in its own vagueness,&mdash;which so much characterised the writings
of his extraordinary friend; and in one of the notes we find Shelley's
favourite Pantheism of Love thus glanced at:&mdash;"But this is not all: the
feeling with which all around Clarens and the opposite rocks of
Meillerie is invested, is of a still higher and more comprehensive order
than the mere sympathy with individual passion; it is a sense of the
existence of love in its most extended and sublime capacity, and of our
own participation of its good and of its glory: it is the great
principle of the universe, which is there more condensed, but not less
manifested; and of which, though knowing ourselves a part, we lose our
individuality, and mingle in the beauty of the whole."</p>

<p>Another proof of the ductility with which he fell into his new friend's
tastes and predilections, appears in the tinge, if not something deeper,
of the manner and cast of thinking of Mr. Wordsworth, which is traceable
through so many of his most beautiful stanzas. Being naturally, from his
love of the abstract and imaginative, an admirer of the great poet of
the Lakes, Mr. Shelley omitted no opportunity of bringing the beauties
of his favourite writer under the notice of Lord Byron; and it is not
surprising that, once persuaded into a fair perusal, the mind of the
noble poet should&mdash;in spite of some personal and political prejudices
which unluckily survived this short access of admiration&mdash;not only feel
the influence but, in some degree, even reflect the hues of one of the
very few real and original poets that this<span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275"></a>Pg 275</span> age (fertile as it is in
rhymers <i>quales ego et Cluvienus</i>) has had the glory of producing.</p>

<p>When Polidori was of their party, (which, till he found attractions
elsewhere, was generally the case,) their more elevated subjects of
conversation were almost always put to flight by the strange sallies of
this eccentric young man, whose vanity made him a constant butt for Lord
Byron's sarcasm and merriment. The son of a highly respectable Italian
gentleman, who was in early life, I understand, the secretary of
Alfieri, Polidori seems to have possessed both talents and dispositions
which, had he lived, might have rendered him a useful member of his
profession and of society. At the time, however, of which we are
speaking, his ambition of distinction far outwent both his powers and
opportunities of attaining it. His mind, accordingly, between ardour and
weakness, was kept in a constant hectic of vanity, and he seems to have
alternately provoked and amused his noble employer, leaving him seldom
any escape from anger but in laughter. Among other pretensions, he had
set his heart upon shining as an author, and one evening at Mr.
Shelley's, producing a tragedy of his own writing, insisted that they
should undergo the operation of hearing it. To lighten the infliction,
Lord Byron took upon himself the task of reader; and the whole scene,
from the description I have heard of it, must have been not a little
trying to gravity. In spite of the jealous watch kept upon every
countenance by the author, it was impossible to withstand the smile
lurking in the eye of the reader, whose only resource against the
outbreak of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276"></a>Pg 276</span> his own laughter lay in lauding, from time to time, most
vehemently, the sublimity of the verses;&mdash;particularly some that began
"'Tis thus the go&icirc;ter'd idiot of the Alps,'&mdash;and then adding, at the
close of every such eulogy, "I assure you when I was in the Drury Lane
Committee, much worse things were offered to us."</p>

<p>After passing a fortnight under the same roof with Lord Byron at
S&eacute;cheron, Mr. and Mrs. Shelley removed to a small house on the
Mont-Blanc side of the Lake, within about ten minutes' walk of the villa
which their noble friend had taken, upon the high banks, called Belle
Rive, that rose immediately behind them. During the fortnight that Lord
Byron outstaid them at S&eacute;cheron, though the weather had changed and was
become windy and cloudy, he every evening crossed the Lake, with
Polidori, to visit them; and "as he returned again (says my informant)
over the darkened waters, the wind, from far across, bore us his voice
singing your Tyrolese Song of Liberty, which I then first heard, and
which is to me inextricably linked with his remembrance."</p>

<p>In the mean time, Polidori had become jealous of the growing intimacy of
his noble patron with Shelley; and the plan which he now understood them
to have formed of making a tour of the Lake without him completed his
mortification. In the soreness of his feelings on this subject he
indulged in some intemperate remonstrances, which Lord Byron indignantly
resented; and the usual bounds of courtesy being passed on both sides,
the dismissal of Polidori appeared, even to himself, inevitable.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>Pg 277</span> With
this prospect, which he considered nothing less than ruin, before his
eyes, the poor young man was, it seems, on the point of committing that
fatal act which, two or three years afterwards, he actually did
perpetrate. Retiring to his own room, he had already drawn forth the
poison from his medicine chest, and was pausing to consider whether he
should write a letter before he took it, when Lord Byron (without,
however, the least suspicion of his intention) tapped at the door and
entered, with his hand held forth in sign of reconciliation. The sudden
revulsion was too much for poor Polidori, who burst into tears; and, in
relating all the circumstances of the occurrence afterwards, he declared
that nothing could exceed the gentle kindness of Lord Byron in soothing
his mind and restoring him to composure.</p>

<p>Soon after this the noble poet removed to Diodati. He had, on his first
coming to Geneva, with the good-natured view of introducing Polidori
into company, gone to several Genevese parties; but, this task
performed, he retired altogether from society till late in the summer,
when, as we have seen, he visited Copet. His means were at this time
very limited; and though he lived by no means parsimoniously, all
unnecessary expenses were avoided in his establishment. The young
physician had been, at first, a source of much expense to him, being in
the habit of hiring a carriage, at a louis a day (Lord Byron not then
keeping horses), to take him to his evening parties; and it was some
time before his noble patron had the courage to put this luxury down.</p>

<p>The liberty, indeed, which this young person<span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278"></a>Pg 278</span> allowed himself was, on
one occasion, the means of bringing an imputation upon the poet's
hospitality and good breeding, which, like every thing else, true or
false, tending to cast a shade upon his character, was for some time
circulated with the most industrious zeal. Without any authority from
the noble owner of the mansion, he took upon himself to invite some
Genevese gentlemen (M. Pictet, and, I believe, M. Bonstetten) to dine at
Diodati; and the punishment which Lord Byron thought it right to inflict
upon him for such freedom was, "as he had invited the guests, to leave
him also to entertain them." This step, though merely a consequence of
the physician's indiscretion, it was not difficult, of course, to
convert into a serious charge of caprice and rudeness against the host
himself.</p>

<p>By such repeated instances of thoughtlessness (to use no harsher term),
it is not wonderful that Lord Byron should at last be driven into a
feeling of distaste towards his medical companion, of whom he one day
remarked, that "he was exactly the kind of person to whom, if he fell
overboard, one would hold out a straw, to know if the adage be true that
drowning men catch at straws."</p>

<p>A few more anecdotes of this young man, while in the service of Lord
Byron, may, as throwing light upon the character of the latter, be not
inappropriately introduced. While the whole party were, one day, out
boating, Polidori, by some accident, in rowing, struck Lord Byron
violently on the knee-pan with his oar; and the latter, without
speaking, turned his face away to hide the pain. After a moment he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279"></a>Pg 279</span>
said, "Be so kind, Polidori, another time, to take more care, for you
hurt me very much."&mdash;"I am glad of it," answered the other; "I am glad
to see you can suffer pain." In a calm suppressed tone, Lord Byron
replied, "Let me advise you, Polidori, when you, another time, hurt any
one, not to express your satisfaction. People don't like to be told that
those who give them pain are glad of it; and they cannot always command
their anger. It was with some difficulty that I refrained from throwing
you into the water; and, but for Mrs. Shelley's presence, I should
probably have done some such rash thing." This was said without ill
temper, and the cloud soon passed away.</p>

<p>Another time, when the lady just mentioned was, after a shower of rain,
walking up the hill to Diodati, Lord Byron, who saw her from his balcony
where he was standing with Polidori, said to the latter, "Now, you who
wish to be gallant ought to jump down this small height, and offer your
arm." Polidori chose the easiest part of the declivity, and leaped;&mdash;but
the ground being wet, his foot slipped, and he sprained his ankle.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
Lord Byron instantly helped to carry him in and procure cold water for
the foot; and, after he was laid on the sofa, perceiving that he was
uneasy, went up stairs himself (an exertion which his lameness made
painful and disagreeable) to fetch a pillow for him. "Well, I did not
believe you had so much feeling," was Polidori's gracious<span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280"></a>Pg 280</span> remark,
which, it may be supposed, not a little clouded the noble poet's brow.</p>

<p>A dialogue which Lord Byron himself used to mention as having taken
place between them during their journey on the Rhine, is amusingly
characteristic of both the persons concerned. "After all," said the
physician, "what is there you can do that I cannot?"&mdash;"Why, since you
force me to say," answered the other, "I think there are three things I
can do which you cannot." Polidori defied him to name them. "I can,"
said Lord Byron, "swim across that river&mdash;I can snuff out that candle
with a pistol-shot at the distance of twenty paces&mdash;and I have written a
poem<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> of which 14,000 copies were sold in one day."</p>

<p>The jealous pique of the Doctor against Shelley was constantly breaking
out; and on the occasion of some victory which the latter had gained
over him in a sailing-match, he took it into his head that his
antagonist had treated him with contempt; and went so far, in
consequence, notwithstanding Shelley's known sentiments against
duelling, as to proffer him a sort of challenge, at which Shelley, as
might be expected, only laughed. Lord Byron, however, fearing that the
vivacious physician might still further take advantage of this
peculiarity of his friend, said to him, "Recollect, that though Shelley
has some scruples about duelling, <i>I</i> have none; and shall be, at all
times, ready to take his place."</p>

<p>At Diodati, his life was passed in the same regular round of habits and
occupations into which, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>Pg 281</span> left to himself, he always naturally fell;
a late breakfast, then a visit to the Shelleys' cottage and an excursion
on the Lake;&mdash;at five, dinner<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> (when he usually preferred being
alone), and then, if the weather permitted, an excursion again. He and
Shelley had joined in purchasing a boat, for which they gave twenty-five
<i>louis</i>,&mdash;a small sailing vessel, fitted to stand the usual squalls of
the climate, and, at that time, the only keeled boat on the Lake. When
the weather did not allow of their excursions after dinner,&mdash;an
occurrence not unfrequent during this very wet summer,&mdash;the inmates of
the cottage passed their evenings at Diodati, and, when the rain
rendered it inconvenient for them to return home, remained there to
sleep. "We often," says one, who was not the least ornamental of the
party, "sat up in conversation till the morning light. There was never
any lack of subjects, and, grave or gay, we were always interested."</p>

<p>During a week of rain at this time, having amused themselves with
reading German ghost-stories, they agreed, at last, to write something
in imitation of them. "You and I," said Lord Byron to Mrs. Shelley,
"will publish ours together." He then began his tale of the Vampire;
and, having the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>Pg 282</span> whole arranged in his head, repeated to them a sketch
of the story<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> one evening,&mdash;but, from the narrative being in prose,
made but little progress in filling up his outline. The most memorable
result, indeed, of their story-telling compact, was Mrs. Shelley's wild
and powerful romance of Frankenstein,&mdash;one of those original conceptions
that take hold of the public mind at once, and for ever.</p>

<p>Towards the latter end of June, as we have seen in one of the preceding
letters, Lord Byron, accompanied by his friend Shelley, made a tour in
his boat round the Lake, and visited, "with the Heloise before him," all
those scenes around Meillerie and Clarens, which have become consecrated
for ever by ideal passion, and by that power which Genius alone
possesses, of giving such life to its dreams as to make them seem
realities. In the squall off Meillerie, which he mentions, their danger
was considerable<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. In the expectation, every moment, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>Pg 283</span> being
obliged to swim for his life, Lord Byron had already thrown off his
coat, and, as Shelley was no swimmer, insisted upon endeavouring, by
some means, to save him. This offer, however, Shelley positively
refused; and seating himself quietly upon a locker, and grasping the
rings at each end firmly in his hands, declared his determination to go
down in that position, without a struggle.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Subjoined to that interesting little work, the "Six Weeks' Tour," there
is a letter by Shelley himself, giving an account of this excursion
round the Lake, and written with all the enthusiasm such scenes should
inspire. In describing a beautiful child they saw at the village of
Nerni, he says, "My companion gave him a piece of money, which he took
without speaking, with a sweet smile of easy thankfulness, and then with
an unembarrassed air<span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>Pg 284</span> turned to his play." There were, indeed, few
things Lord Byron more delighted in than to watch beautiful children at
play;&mdash;"many a lovely Swiss child (says a person who saw him daily at
this time) received crowns from him as the reward of their grace and
sweetness."</p>

<p>Speaking of their lodgings at Nerni, which were gloomy and dirty, Mr.
Shelley says, "On returning to our inn, we found that the servant had
arranged our rooms, and deprived them of the greater portion of their
former disconsolate appearance. They reminded my companion of
Greece:&mdash;it was five years, he said, since he had slept in such beds."</p>

<p>Luckily for Shelley's full enjoyment of these scenes, he had never
before happened to read the Heloise; and though his companion had long
been familiar with that romance, the sight of the region itself, the
"birth-place of deep Love," every spot of which seemed instinct with the
passion of the story, gave to the whole a fresh and actual existence in
his mind. Both were under the spell of the Genius of the place,&mdash;both
full of emotion; and as they walked silently through the vineyards that
were once the "bosquet de Julie," Lord Byron suddenly exclaimed, "Thank
God, Polidori is not here."</p>

<p>That the glowing stanzas suggested to him by this scene were written
upon the spot itself appears almost certain, from the letter addressed
to Mr. Murray on his way back to Diodati, in which he announces the
third Canto as complete, and consisting of 117 stanzas. At Ouchy, near
Lausanne,&mdash;the place from which that letter is dated&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285"></a>Pg 285</span> and his friend
were detained two days, in a small inn, by the weather: and it was
there, in that short interval, that he wrote his "Prisoner of Chillon,"
adding one more deathless association to the already immortalised
localities of the Lake.</p>

<p>On his return from this excursion to Diodati, an occasion was afforded
for the gratification of his jesting propensities by the avowal of the
young physician that&mdash;he had fallen in love. On the evening of this
tender confession they both appeared at Shelley's cottage&mdash;Lord Byron,
in the highest and most boyish spirits, rubbing his hands as he walked
about the room, and in that utter incapacity of retention which was one
of his foibles, making jesting allusions to the secret he had just
heard. The brow of the Doctor darkened as this pleasantry went on, and,
at last, he angrily accused Lord Byron of hardness of heart. "I never,"
said he, "met with a person so unfeeling." This sally, though the poet
had evidently brought it upon himself, annoyed him most deeply. "Call
<i>me</i> cold-hearted&mdash;<i>me</i> insensible!" he exclaimed, with manifest
emotion&mdash;"as well might you say that glass is not brittle, which has
been cast down a precipice, and lies dashed to pieces at the foot!"</p>

<p>In the month of July he paid a visit to Copet, and was received by the
distinguished hostess with a cordiality the more sensibly felt by him
as, from his personal unpopularity at this time, he had hardly ventured
to count upon it.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> In her usual frank <span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name="page286"></a>Pg 286</span>style, she took him to task
upon his matrimonial conduct&mdash;but in a way that won upon his mind, and
disposed him to yield to her suggestions. He must endeavour, she told
him, to bring about a reconciliation with his wife, and must submit to
contend no longer with the opinion of the world. In vain did he quote
her own motto to Delphine, "Un homme peut braver, une femme doit se
succomber aux opinions du monde;"&mdash;her reply was, that all this might be
very well to say, but that, in real life, the duty and necessity of
yielding belonged also to the man. Her eloquence, in short, so far
succeeded, that he was prevailed upon to write a letter to a friend in
England, declaring himself still willing to be reconciled to Lady
Byron,&mdash;a concession not a little startling to those who had so often,
lately, heard him declare that, "having done all in his power to
persuade Lady Byron to return, and with this view put off as long as he
could signing the deed of separation, that step being once taken, they
were now divided for ever."</p>

<p>Of the particulars of this brief negotiation that ensued upon Madame de
Sta&euml;l's suggestion, I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287"></a>Pg 287</span> no very accurate remembrance; but there can
be little doubt that its failure, after the violence he had done his own
pride in the overture, was what first infused any mixture of resentment
or bitterness into the feelings hitherto entertained by him throughout
these painful differences. He had, indeed, since his arrival in Geneva,
invariably spoken of his lady with kindness and regret, imputing the
course she had taken, in leaving him, not to herself but others, and
assigning whatever little share of blame he would allow her to bear in
the transaction to the simple and, doubtless, true cause&mdash;her not at all
understanding him. "I have no doubt," he would sometimes say, "that she
really did believe me to be mad."</p>

<p>Another resolution connected with his matrimonial affairs, in which he
often, at this time, professed his fixed intention to persevere, was
that of never allowing himself to touch any part of his wife's fortune.
Such a sacrifice, there is no doubt, would have been, in his situation,
delicate and manly; but though the natural bent of his disposition led
him to <i>make</i> the resolution, he wanted,&mdash;what few, perhaps, could have
attained,&mdash;the fortitude to <i>keep</i> it.</p>

<p>The effects of the late struggle on his mind, in stirring up all its
resources and energies, was visible in the great activity of his genius
during the whole of this period, and the rich variety, both in character
and colouring, of the works with which it teemed. Besides the third
Canto of Childe Harold and the Prisoner of Chillon, he produced also his
two poems, "Darkness" and "The Dream," the latter of which cost him many
a tear in writing,&mdash;being, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288"></a>Pg 288</span> the most mournful, as well as
picturesque, "story of a wandering life" that ever came from the pen and
heart of man. Those verses, too, entitled "The Incantation," which he
introduced afterwards, without any connection with the subject, into
Manfred, were also (at least, the less bitter portion of them) the
production of this period; and as they were written soon after the last
fruitless attempt at reconciliation, it is needless to say who was in
his thoughts while he penned some of the opening stanzas.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Besides the unfinished "Vampire," he began also, at this time, another
romance in prose, founded upon the story of the Marriage of Belphegor,
and intended<span class="pagenum"><a id="page289" name="page289"></a>Pg 289</span> to shadow out his own matrimonial fate. The wife of this
satanic personage he described much in the same spirit that pervades his
delineation of Donna Inez in the first Canto of Don Juan. While engaged,
however, in writing this story, he heard from England that Lady Byron
was ill, and, his heart softening at the intelligence, he threw the
manuscript into the fire. So constantly were the good and evil
principles of his nature conflicting for mastery over him.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>The two following Poems, so different from each other in their
character,&mdash;the first prying with an awful scepticism into the darkness
of another world, and the second breathing all that is most natural and
tender in the affections of this,&mdash;were also written at this time, and
have never before been published.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Martigny, October 9. 1816.</p>

<p>"Thus far on my way to Italy. We have just passed the 'Fisse-Vache'
(one of the first torrents in Switzerland) in time to view the iris
which the sun flings along it before noon.</p>

<p>"I have written to you twice lately. Mr. Davies, I hear, is
arrived. He brings the original MS. which you wished to see.
Recollect that the printing is to be from that which Mr. Shelley
brought; and recollect, also, that the concluding stanzas of Childe
Harold (those to my <i>daughter</i>) which I had not made up my mind
whether to publish or not when they were <i>first</i> written (as you
will see marked on the margin of the first copy), I had (and have)
fully determined to publish with the rest of the Canto, as in the
copy which you received by Mr. Shelley, before I sent it to
England.</p>

been.&mdash;At Milan I shall expect to hear from you. Address either to
Milan, <i>poste restante</i>, or by way of Geneva, to the care of Monsr.
Hentsch, Banquier. I write these few lines in case my other letter
should not reach you: I trust one of them will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>Pg 298</span>"P.S. My best respects and regards to Mr. Gifford. Will you tell
him it may perhaps be as well to put a short note to that part
relating to <i>Clarens</i>, merely to say, that of course the
description does not refer to that particular spot so much as to
the command of scenery round it? I do not know that this is
necessary, and leave it to Mr. G.'s choice, as my editor,&mdash;if he
will allow me to call him so at this distance."</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER 249. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Milan, October 15. 1816.</p>

<p>"I hear that Mr. Davies has arrived in England,&mdash;but that of some
letters, &amp;c., committed to his care by Mr. H., only <i>half</i> have
been delivered. This intelligence naturally makes me feel a little
anxious for mine, and amongst them for the MS., which I wished to
have compared with the one sent by me through the hands of Mr.
Shelley. I trust that <i>it</i> has arrived safely,&mdash;and indeed not less
so, that some little crystals, &amp;c., from Mont Blanc, for my
daughter and my nieces, have reached their address. Pray have the
goodness to ascertain from Mr. Davies that no accident (by
custom-house or loss) has befallen them, and satisfy me on this
point at your earliest convenience.</p>

<p>"If I recollect rightly, you told me that Mr. Gifford had kindly
undertaken to correct the press (at my request) during my
absence&mdash;at least I hope so. It will add to my many obligations to
that gentleman.</p>

<p>"I wrote to you, on my way here, a short note, dated Martigny. Mr.
Hobhouse and myself arrived<span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>Pg 299</span> here a few days ago, by the Simplon
and Lago Maggiore route. Of course we visited the Borromean
Islands, which are fine, but too artificial. The Simplon is
magnificent in its nature and its art,&mdash;both God and man have done
wonders,&mdash;to say nothing of the devil who must certainly have had a
hand (or a hoof) in some of the rocks and ravines through and over
which the works are carried.</p>

<p>"Milan is striking&mdash;the cathedral superb. The city altogether
reminds me of Seville, but a little inferior. We had heard divers
bruits, and took precautions on the road, near the frontier,
against some 'many worthy fellows (i.e. felons) that were out,' and
had ransacked some preceding travellers, a few weeks ago, near
Sesto,&mdash;or <i>C</i>esto, I forget which,&mdash;of cash and raiment, besides
putting them in bodily fear, and lodging about twenty slugs in the
retreating part of a courier belonging to Mr. Hope. But we were not
molested, and I do not think in any danger, except of making
mistakes in the way of cocking and priming whenever we saw an old
house, or an ill-looking thicket, and now and then suspecting the
'true men,' who have very much the appearance of the thieves of
other countries. What the thieves may look like, I know not, nor
desire to know, for it seems they come upon you in bodies of thirty
('in buckram and Kendal green') at a time, so that voyagers have no
great chance. It is something like poor dear Turkey in that
respect, but not so good, for there you can have as great a body of
rogues to match the regular banditti; but here the gens d'armes are
said to be no great things,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>Pg 300</span> and as for one's own people, one can't
carry them about like Robinson Crusoe with a gun on each shoulder.</p>

<p>"I have been to the Ambrosian library&mdash;it is a fine
collection&mdash;full of MSS. edited and unedited. I enclose you a list
of the former recently published: these are matters for your
literati. For me, in my simple way, I have been most delighted with
a correspondence of letters, all original and amatory, between
<i>Lucretia Borgia</i> and <i>Cardinal Bembo</i>, preserved there. I have
pored over them and a lock of her hair, the prettiest and fairest
imaginable&mdash;I never saw fairer&mdash;and shall go repeatedly to read the
epistles over and over; and if I can obtain some of the hair by
fair means, I shall try. I have already persuaded the librarian to
promise me copies of the letters, and I hope he will not disappoint
me. They are short, but very simple, sweet, and to the purpose;
there are some copies of verses in Spanish also by her; the tress
of her hair is long, and, as I said before, beautiful. The Brera
gallery of paintings has some fine pictures, but nothing of a
collection. Of painting I know nothing; but I like a Guercino&mdash;a
picture of Abraham putting away Hagar and Ishmael&mdash;which seems to
me natural and goodly. The Flemish school, such as I saw it in
Flanders, I utterly detested, despised, and abhorred; it might be
painting, but it was not nature; the Italian is pleasing, and their
<i>ideal</i> very noble.</p>

<p>"The Italians I have encountered here are very intelligent and
agreeable. In a few days I am to meet Monti. By the way, I have
just heard an<span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301"></a>Pg 301</span> anecdote of Beccaria, who published such admirable
things against the punishment of death. As soon as his book was
out, his servant (having read it, I presume) stole his watch; and
his master, while correcting the press of a second edition, did all
he could to have him hanged by way of advertisement.</p>

<p>"I forgot to mention the triumphal arch begun by Napoleon, as a
gate to this city. It is unfinished, but the part completed worthy
of another age and the same country. The society here is very oddly
carried on,&mdash;at the theatre, and the theatre only,&mdash;which answers
to our opera. People meet there as at a rout, but in very small
circles. From Milan I shall go to Venice. If you write, write to
Geneva, as before&mdash;the letter will be forwarded.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Milan, November 1. 1816.</p>

<p>"I have recently written to you rather frequently but without any
late answer. Mr. Hobhouse and myself set out for Venice in a few
days; but you had better still address to me at Mr. Hentsch's,
Banquier, Geneva; he will forward your letters.</p>

<p>"I do not know whether I mentioned to you some time ago, that I had
parted with the Dr. Polidori a few weeks previous to my leaving
Diodati. I know no great harm of him; but he had an alacrity of
getting into scrapes, and was too young and heedless; and having
enough to attend to in my own concerns, and without time to become
his tutor, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>Pg 302</span> thought it much better to give him his cong&eacute;. He
arrived at Milan some weeks before Mr. Hobhouse and myself. About a
week ago, in consequence of a quarrel at the theatre with an
Austrian officer, in which he was exceedingly in the wrong, he has
contrived to get sent out of the territory, and is gone to
Florence. I was not present, the pit having been the scene of
altercation; but on being sent for from the Cavalier Breme's box,
where I was quietly staring at the ballet, I found the man of
medicine begirt with grenadiers, arrested by the guard, conveyed
into the guard-room, where there was much swearing in several
languages. They were going to keep him there for the night; but on
my giving my name, and answering for his apparition next morning,
he was permitted egress. Next day he had an order from the
government to be gone in twenty-four hours, and accordingly gone he
is, some days ago. We did what we could for him, but to no purpose;
and indeed he brought it upon himself, as far as I could learn, for
I was not present at the squabble itself. I believe this is the
real state of his case; and I tell it you because I believe things
sometimes reach you in England in a false or exaggerated form. We
found Milan very polite and hospitable<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303"></a>Pg 303</span> have the same

<p><b>LETTER 251. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Verona, November 6. 1816.</p>

<p>"My dear Moore,</p>

<p>"Your letter, written before my departure from England, and
addressed to me in London, only reached me recently. Since that
period, I have been over a portion of that part of Europe which I
had not already seen. About a month since, I crossed the Alps from
Switzerland to Milan, which I left a few days ago, and am thus far
on my way to Venice, where I shall probably winter. Yesterday I was
on the shores of the Benacus, with his <i>fluctibus et fremitu</i>.
Catullus's Sirmium has still its name and site, and is remembered
for his sake: but the very heavy autumnal rains and mists prevented
our quitting our route, (that is, Hobhouse and myself, who are at
present voyaging together,) as it was better not to see it at all
than to a great disadvantage.</p>

<p>"I found on the Benacus the same tradition of a city, still visible
in calm weather below the waters, which you have preserved of Lough
Neagh, 'When the clear, cold eve's declining.' I do not know that
it is authorised by records; but they tell you such a story, and
say that the city was swallowed up by an earthquake. We moved
to-day over the frontier to Verona, by a road suspected of
thieves,&mdash;'the wise <i>convey</i> it call,'&mdash;but without molestation. I
shall remain here a day or two to gape at the usual
marvels,&mdash;amphitheatre, paintings, and all that time-tax of
travel,&mdash;though Catullus, Claudian, and Shakspeare have done more
for Verona than it ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="page305" name="page305"></a>Pg 305</span> did for itself. They still pretend to
show, I believe, the 'tomb of all the Capulets'&mdash;we shall see.</p>

<p>"Among many things at Milan, one pleased me particularly, viz. the
correspondence (in the prettiest love-letters in the world) of
Lucretia Borgia with Cardinal Bembo, (who, <i>you say</i>, made a very
good cardinal,) and a lock of her hair, and some Spanish verses of
hers,&mdash;the lock very fair and beautiful. I took one single hair of
it as a relic, and wished sorely to get a copy of one or two of the
letters; but it is prohibited: <i>that</i> I don't mind; but it was
impracticable; and so I only got some of them by heart. They are
kept in the Ambrosian Library, which I often visited to look them
over&mdash;to the scandal of the librarian, who wanted to enlighten me
with sundry valuable MSS., classical, philosophical, and pious. But
I stick to the Pope's daughter, and wish myself a cardinal.</p>

<p>"I have seen the finest parts of Switzerland, the Rhine, the Rhone,
and the Swiss and Italian lakes; for the beauties of which, I refer
you to the Guidebook. The north of Italy is tolerably free from the
English; but the south swarms with them, I am told. Madame de Sta&euml;l
I saw frequently at Copet, which she renders remarkably pleasant.
She has been particularly kind to me. I was for some months her
neighbour, in a country house called Diodati, which I had on the
Lake of Geneva. My plans are very uncertain; but it is probable
that you will see me in England in the spring. I have some business
there. If you write to me, will you address to the care of Mons.
Hentsch, Banquier, Geneva, who re<span class="pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306"></a>Pg 306</span>ceives and forwards my letters.
Remember me to Rogers, who wrote to me lately, with a short account
of your poem, which, I trust, is near the light. He speaks of it
most highly.</p>

<p>"My health is very endurable, except that I am subject to casual
giddiness and faintness, which is so like a fine lady, that I am
rather ashamed of the disorder. When I sailed, I had a physician
with me, whom, after some months of patience, I found it expedient
to part with, before I left Geneva some time. On arriving at Milan,
I found this gentleman in very good society, where he prospered for
some weeks: but, at length, at the theatre he quarrelled with an
Austrian officer, and was sent out by the government in twenty-four
hours. I was not present at his squabble; but, on hearing that he
was put under arrest, I went and got him out of his confinement,
but could not prevent his being sent off, which, indeed, he partly
deserved, being quite in the wrong, and having begun a row for
row's sake. I had preceded the Austrian government some weeks
myself, in giving him his cong&eacute; from Geneva. He is not a bad
fellow, but very young and hot-headed, and more likely to incur
diseases than to cure them. Hobhouse and myself found it useless to
intercede for him. This happened some time before we left Milan. He
is gone to Florence.</p>

<p>"At Milan I saw, and was visited by, Monti, the most celebrated of
the living Italian poets. He seems near sixty; in face he is like
the late Cooke the actor. His frequent changes in politics have
made him very unpopular as a man. I saw many<span class="pagenum"><a id="page307" name="page307"></a>Pg 307</span> more of their
literati; but none whose names are well known in England, except
Acerbi. I lived much with the Italians, particularly with the
Marquis of Breme's family, who are very able and intelligent men,
especially the Abate. There was a famous improvvisatore who held
forth while I was there. His fluency astonished me; but, although I
understand Italian, and speak it (with more readiness than
accuracy), I could only carry off a few very common-place
mythological images, and one line about Artemisia, and another
about Algiers, with sixty words of an entire tragedy about Etocles
and Polynices. Some of the Italians liked him&mdash;others called his
performance 'seccatura' (a devilish good word, by the way)&mdash;and all
Milan was in controversy about him.</p>

<p>"The state of morals in these parts is in some sort lax. A mother
and son were pointed out at the theatre, as being pronounced by the
Milanese world to be of the Theban dynasty&mdash;but this was all. The
narrator (one of the first men in Milan) seemed to be not
sufficiently scandalised by the taste or the tie. All society in
Milan is carried on at the opera: they have private boxes, where
they play at cards, or talk, or any thing else; but (except at the
Cassino) there are no open houses, or balls, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>"The peasant girls have all very fine dark eyes, and many of them
are beautiful. There are also two dead bodies in fine
preservation&mdash;one Saint Carlo Boromeo, at Milan; the other not a
saint, but a chief, named Visconti, at Monza&mdash;both of which
appeared very agreeable. In one of the Boromean<span class="pagenum"><a id="page308" name="page308"></a>Pg 308</span> isles (the Isola
bella), there is a large laurel&mdash;the largest known&mdash;on which
Buonaparte, staying there just before the battle of Marengo, carved
with his knife the word 'Battaglia.' I saw the letters, now half
worn out and partly erased.</p>

<p>"Excuse this tedious letter. To be tiresome is the privilege of old
age and absence: I avail myself of the latter, and the former I
have anticipated. If I do not speak to you of my own affairs, it is
not from want of confidence, but to spare you and myself. My day is
over&mdash;what then?&mdash;I have had it. To be sure, I have shortened it;
and if I had done as much by this letter, it would have been as
well. But you will forgive that, if not the other faults of</p>

<p>"Yours ever and most affectionately,</p>

<p>"B.</p>

<p>"P.S. November 7. 1816.</p>

<p>"I have been over Verona. The amphitheatre is wonderful&mdash;beats even
Greece. Of the truth of Juliet's story they seem tenacious to a
degree, insisting on the fact&mdash;giving a date (1303), and showing a
tomb. It is a plain, open, and partly decayed sarcophagus, with
withered leaves in it, in a wild and desolate conventual garden,
once a cemetery, now ruined to the very graves. The situation
struck me as very appropriate to the legend, being blighted as
their love. I have brought away a few pieces of the granite, to
give to my daughter and my nieces. Of the other marvels of this
city, paintings, antiquities, &amp;c., excepting the tombs of the
Scaliger princes, I have no pretensions<span class="pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309"></a>Pg 309</span> to judge. The gothic
monuments of the Scaligers pleased me, but 'a poor virtuoso am I,'
and ever yours."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It must have been observed, in my account of Lord Byron's life previous
to his marriage, that, without leaving altogether unnoticed (what,
indeed, was too notorious to be so evaded) certain affairs of gallantry
in which he had the reputation of being engaged, I have thought it
right, besides refraining from such details in my narrative, to suppress
also whatever passages in his Journals and Letters might be supposed to
bear too personally or particularly on the same delicate topics.
Incomplete as the strange history of his mind and heart must, in one of
its most interesting chapters, be left by these omissions, still a
deference to that peculiar sense of decorum in this country, which marks
the mention of such frailties as hardly a less crime than the commission
of them, and, still more, the regard due to the feelings of the living,
who ought not rashly to be made to suffer for the errors of the dead,
have combined to render this sacrifice, however much it may be
regretted, necessary.</p>

<p>We have now, however, shifted the scene to a region where less caution
is requisite;&mdash;where, from the different standard applied to female
morals in these respects, if the wrong itself be not lessened by this
diminution of the consciousness of it, less scruple may be, at least,
felt towards persons so circumstanced, and whatever delicacy we may
think right to exercise in speaking of their frailties must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>Pg 310</span> with
reference rather to our views and usages than theirs.</p>

<p>Availing myself, with this latter qualification, of the greater latitude
thus allowed me, I shall venture so far to depart from the plan hitherto
pursued, as to give, with but little suppression, the noble poet's
letters relative to his Italian adventures. To throw a veil altogether
over these irregularities of his private life would be to afford&mdash;were
it even practicable&mdash;but a partial portraiture of his character; while,
on the other hand, to rob him of the advantage of being himself the
historian of his errors (where no injury to others can flow from the
disclosure) would be to deprive him of whatever softening light can be
thrown round such transgressions by the vivacity and fancy, the
passionate love of beauty, and the strong yearning after affection which
will be found to have, more or less, mingled with even the least refined
of his attachments. Neither is any great danger to be apprehended from
the sanction or seduction of such an example; as they who would dare to
plead the authority of Lord Byron for their errors must first be able to
trace them to the same palliating sources,&mdash;to that sensibility, whose
very excesses showed its strength and depth,&mdash;that stretch of
imagination, to the very verge, perhaps, of what reason can bear without
giving way,&mdash;that whole combination, in short, of grand but disturbing
powers, which alone could be allowed to extenuate such moral
derangement, but which, even in him thus dangerously gifted, were
insufficient to excuse it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name="page311"></a>Pg 311</span>Having premised these few observations, I shall now proceed, with less
interruption, to lay his correspondence, during this and the two
succeeding years, before the reader:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>LETTER 252. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, November 17. 1816.</p>

<p>"I wrote to you from Verona the other day in my progress hither,
which letter I hope you will receive. Some three years ago, or it
may be more, I recollect your telling me that you had received a
letter from our friend Sam, dated 'On board his gondola.' <i>My</i>
gondola is, at this present, waiting for me on the canal; but I
prefer writing to you in the house, it being autumn&mdash;and rather an
English autumn than otherwise. It is my intention to remain at
Venice during the winter, probably, as it has always been (next to
the East) the greenest island of my imagination. It has not
disappointed me; though its evident decay would, perhaps, have that
effect upon others. But I have been familiar with ruins too long to
dislike desolation. Besides, I have fallen in love, which, next to
falling into the canal, (which would be of no use, as I can swim,)
is the best or the worst thing I could do. I have got some
extremely good apartments in the house of a 'Merchant of Venice,'
who is a good deal occupied with business, and has a wife in her
twenty-second year. Marianna (that is her name) is in her
appearance altogether like an antelope. She has the large, black,
oriental eyes, with that peculiar expression in them which is seen
rarely among <i>Eu<span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312"></a>Pg 312</span>ropeans</i>&mdash;even the Italians&mdash;and which many of the
Turkish women give themselves by tinging the eyelid,&mdash;an art not
known out of that country, I believe. This expression she has
<i>naturally</i>,&mdash;and something more than this. In short, I cannot
describe the effect of this kind of eye,&mdash;at least upon me. Her
features are regular, and rather aquiline&mdash;mouth small&mdash;skin clear
and soft, with a kind of hectic colour&mdash;forehead remarkably good:
her hair is of the dark gloss, curl, and colour of Lady J * *'s:
her figure is light and pretty, and she is a famous
songstress&mdash;scientifically so; her natural voice (in conversation,
I mean) is very sweet; and the na&iuml;vet&eacute; of the Venetian dialect is
always pleasing in the mouth of a woman.</p>

<p>"November 23.</p>

<p>"You will perceive that my description, which was proceeding with
the minuteness of a passport, has been interrupted for several
days.</p>

<p>"December 5.</p>

<p>"Since my former dates, I do not know that I have much to add on
the subject, and, luckily, nothing to take away; for I am more
pleased than ever with my Venetian, and begin to feel very serious
on that point&mdash;so much so, that I shall be silent.</p>

<p>"By way of divertisement, I am studying daily, at an Armenian
monastery, the Armenian language. I found that my mind wanted
something craggy to break upon; and this&mdash;as the most difficult
thing I could discover here for an amusement&mdash;I have chosen, to
torture me into attention. It is a rich<span class="pagenum"><a id="page313" name="page313"></a>Pg 313</span> language, however, and
would amply repay any one the trouble of learning it. I try, and
shall go on;&mdash;but I answer for nothing, least of all for my
intentions or my success. There are some very curious MSS. in the
monastery, as well as books; translations also from Greek
originals, now lost, and from Persian and Syriac, &amp;c.; besides
works of their own people. Four years ago the French instituted an
Armenian professorship. Twenty pupils presented themselves on
Monday morning, full of noble ardour, ingenuous youth, and
impregnable industry. They persevered, with a courage worthy of the
nation and of universal conquest, till Thursday; when <i>fifteen</i> of
the <i>twenty</i> succumbed to the six-and-twentieth letter of the
alphabet. It is, to be sure, a Waterloo of an Alphabet&mdash;that must
be said for them. But it is so like these fellows, to do by it as
they did by their sovereigns&mdash;abandon both; to parody the old
rhymes, 'Take a thing and give a thing'&mdash;'Take a king and give a
king.' They are the worst of animals, except their conquerors.</p>

<p>"I hear that H&mdash;&mdash;n is your neighbour, having a living in
Derbyshire. You will find him an excellent-hearted fellow, as well
as one of the cleverest; a little, perhaps, too much japanned by
preferment in the church and the tuition of youth, as well as
inoculated with the disease of domestic felicity, besides being
over-run with fine feelings about woman and <i>constancy</i> (that small
change of Love, which people exact so rigidly, receive in such
counterfeit coin, and repay in baser metal); but, otherwise, a very
worthy man, who has lately got a pretty wife, and (I suppose)<span class="pagenum"><a id="page314" name="page314"></a>Pg 314</span> a
child by this time. Pray remember me to him, and say that I know
not which to envy most his neighbourhood&mdash;him, or you.</p>

<p>"Of Venice I shall say little. You must have seen many
descriptions; and they are most of them like. It is a poetical
place; and classical, to us, from Shakspeare and Otway. I have not
yet sinned against it in verse, nor do I know that I shall do so,
having been tuneless since I crossed the Alps, and feeling, as yet,
no renewal of the 'estro.' By the way, I suppose you have seen
'Glenarvon.' Madame de Sta&euml;l lent it me to read from Copet last
autumn. It seems to me that if the authoress had written the
<i>truth</i>, and nothing but the truth&mdash;the whole truth&mdash;the <i>romance</i>
would not only have been more romantic, but more entertaining. As
for the likeness, the picture can't be good&mdash;I did not sit long
enough. When you have leisure, let me hear from and of you,
believing me ever and truly yours most affectionately, B.</p>

<p>"P.S. Oh! <i>your poem</i>&mdash;is it out? I hope Longman has paid his
thousands: but don't you do as H * * T * *'s father did, who,
having made money by a quarto tour, became a vinegar merchant;
when, lo! his vinegar turned sweet (and be d&mdash;&mdash;d to it) and ruined
him. My last letter to you (from Verona) was enclosed to
Murray&mdash;have you got it? Direct to me <i>here, poste restante</i>. There
are no English here at present. There were several in
Switzerland&mdash;some women; but, except Lady Dalrymple Hamil<span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315"></a>Pg 315</span>ton, most

<p><b>LETTER 253. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, December 24. 1816.</p>

<p>"I have taken a fit of writing to you, which portends postage&mdash;once
from Verona&mdash;once from Venice, and again from Venice&mdash;<i>thrice</i> that
is. For this you may thank yourself, for I heard that you
complained of my silence&mdash;so, here goes for garrulity.</p>

<p>"I trust that you received my other twain of letters. My 'way of
life' (or 'May of life,' which is it, according to the
commentators?)&mdash;my 'way of life' is fallen into great regularity.
In the mornings I go over in my gondola to babble Armenian with the
friars of the convent of St. Lazarus, and to help one of them in
correcting the English of an English and Armenian grammar which he
is publishing. In the evenings I do one of many nothings&mdash;either at
the theatres, or some of the conversaziones, which are like our
routs, or rather worse, for the women sit in a semicircle by the
lady of the mansion, and the men stand about the room. To be sure,
there is one improvement upon ours&mdash;instead of lemonade with their
ices, they hand about stiff <i>rum-punch&mdash;punch</i>, by my palate; and
this they think <i>English</i>. I would not disabuse them of so
agreeable an error,&mdash;'no, not for Venice.'</p>

<p>"Last night I was at the Count Governor's, which, of course,
comprises the best society, and is very<span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316"></a>Pg 316</span> much like other gregarious
meetings in every country,&mdash;as in ours,&mdash;except that, instead of
the Bishop of Winchester, you have the Patriarch of Venice, and a
motley crew of Austrians, Germans, noble Venetians, foreigners,
and, if you see a quiz, you may be sure he is a Consul. Oh, by the
way, I forgot, when I wrote from Verona, to tell you that at Milan
I met with a countryman of yours&mdash;a Colonel * * * *, a very
excellent, good-natured fellow, who knows and shows all about
Milan, and is, as it were, a native there. He is particularly civil
to strangers, and this is his history,&mdash;at least, an episode of it.</p>

<p>"Six-and-twenty years ago, Col. * * * *, then an ensign, being in
Italy, fell in love with the Marchesa * * * *, and she with him.
The lady must be, at least, twenty years his senior. The war broke
out; he returned to England, to serve&mdash;not his country, for that's
Ireland&mdash;but England, which is a different thing; and <i>she</i>&mdash;heaven
knows what she did. In the year 1814, the first annunciation of the
Definitive Treaty of Peace (and tyranny) was developed to the
astonished Milanese by the arrival of Col. * * * *, who, flinging
himself full length at the feet of Mad. * * * *, murmured forth, in
half-forgotten Irish Italian, eternal vows of indelible constancy.
The lady screamed, and exclaimed, 'Who are you?' The Colonel cried,
'What! don't you know me? I am so and so,' &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.; till, at
length, the Marchesa, mounting from reminiscence to reminiscence,
through the lovers of the intermediate twenty-five years, arrived
at last at the recollection of her <i>povero</i> sub-<span class="pagenum"><a id="page317" name="page317"></a>Pg 317</span>lieutenant. She
then said, 'Was there ever such virtue?' (that was her very word)
and, being now a widow, gave him apartments in her palace,
reinstated him in all the rights of wrong, and held him up to the
admiring world as a miracle of incontinent fidelity, and the
unshaken Abdiel of absence.</p>

<p>"Methinks this is as pretty a moral tale as any of Marmontel's.
Here is another. The same lady, several years ago, made an escapade
with a Swede, Count Fersen (the same whom the Stockholm mob
quartered and lapidated not very long since), and they arrived at
an Osteria on the road to Rome or thereabouts. It was a summer
evening, and, while they were at supper, they were suddenly regaled
by a symphony of fiddles in an adjacent apartment, so prettily
played, that, wishing to hear them more distinctly, the Count rose,
and going into the musical society, said, 'Gentlemen, I am sure
that, as a company of gallant cavaliers, you will be delighted to
show your skill to a lady, who feels anxious,' &amp;c. &amp;c. The men of
harmony were all acquiescence&mdash;every instrument was tuned and
toned, and, striking up one of their most ambrosial airs, the whole
band followed the Count to the lady's apartment. At their head was
the first fiddler, who, bowing and fiddling at the same moment,
headed his troop and advanced up the room. Death and discord!&mdash;it
was the Marquis himself, who was on a serenading party in the
country, while his spouse had run away from town. The rest may be
imagined&mdash;but, first of all, the lady tried to persuade him that
she was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318"></a>Pg 318</span> there on purpose to meet him, and had chosen this method
for an harmonic surprise. So much for this gossip, which amused me
when I heard it, and I send it to you, in the hope it may have the
like effect. Now we'll return to Venice.</p>

<p>"The day after to-morrow (to-morrow being Christmas-day) the
Carnival begins. I dine with the Countess Albrizzi and a party, and
go to the opera. On that day the Phenix, (not the Insurance Office,
but) the theatre of that name, opens: I have got me a box there for
the season, for two reasons, one of which is, that the music is
remarkably good. The Contessa Albrizzi, of whom I have made
mention, is the De Sta&euml;l of Venice, not young, but a very learned,
unaffected, good-natured woman, very polite to strangers, and, I
believe, not at all dissolute, as most of the women are. She has
written very well on the works of Canova, and also a volume of
Characters, besides other printed matter. She is of Corfu, but
married a dead Venetian&mdash;that is, dead since he married.</p>

<p>"My flame (my 'Donna' whom I spoke of in my former epistle, my
Marianna) is still my Marianna, and I, her&mdash;what she pleases. She
is by far the prettiest woman I have seen here, and the most
loveable I have met with any where&mdash;as well as one of the most
singular. I believe I told you the rise and progress of our
<i>liaison</i> in my former letter. Lest that should not have reached
you, I will merely repeat, that she is a Venetian, two-and-twenty
years old, married to a merchant well to do in the world, and that
she has great black oriental eyes, and all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page319" name="page319"></a>Pg 319</span> qualities which her
eyes promise. Whether being in love with her has steeled me or not,
I do not know; but I have not seen many other women who seem
pretty. The nobility, in particular, are a sad-looking race&mdash;the
gentry rather better. And now, what art <i>thou</i> doing?</p>

<p><b>LETTER 254. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, November 25. 1816.</p>

<p>"It is some months since I have heard from or of you&mdash;I think, not
since I left Diodati. From Milan I wrote once or twice; but have
been here some little time, and intend to pass the winter without
removing. I was much pleased with the Lago di<span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name="page322"></a>Pg 322</span> Garda, and with
Verona, particularly the amphitheatre, and a sarcophagus in a
convent garden, which they show as Juliet's: they insist on the
<i>truth</i> of her history. Since my arrival at Venice, the lady of the
Austrian governor told me that between Verona and Vicenza there are
still ruins of the castle of the <i>Montecchi</i>, and a chapel once
appertaining to the Capulets. Romeo seems to have been of Vicenza
by the tradition; but I was a good deal surprised to find so firm a
faith in Bandello's novel, which seems really to have been founded
on a fact.</p>

<p>"Venice pleases me as much as I expected, and I expected much. It
is one of those places which I know before I see them, and has
always haunted me the most after the East. I like the gloomy gaiety
of their gondolas, and the silence of their canals. I do not even
dislike the evident decay of the city, though I regret the
singularity of its vanished costume; however, there is much left
still; the Carnival, too, is coming.</p>

<p>"St. Mark's, and indeed Venice, is most alive at night. The
theatres are not open till <i>nine</i>, and the society is
proportionably late. All this is to my taste, but most of your
countrymen miss and regret the rattle of hackney coaches, without
which they can't sleep.</p>

<p>"I have got remarkably good apartments in a private house; I see
something of the inhabitants (having had a good many letters to
some of them); I have got my gondola; I read a little, and luckily
could speak Italian (more fluently than correctly) long ago, I am
studying, out of curiosity, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page323" name="page323"></a>Pg 323</span> <i>Venetian</i> dialect, which is very
na&iuml;ve, and soft, and peculiar, though not at all classical; I go
out frequently, and am in very good contentment.</p>

<p>"The Helen of Canova (a bust which is in the house of Madame the
Countess d'Albrizzi, whom I know) is, without exception, to my
mind, the most perfectly beautiful of human conceptions, and far
beyond my ideas of human execution.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i6">Beyond the bard's defeated art,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With immortality her dower,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Behold the <i>Helen</i> of the <i>heart</i>!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Talking of the 'heart' reminds me that I have fallen in
love&mdash;fathomless love; but lest you should make some splendid
mistake, and envy me the possession of some of those princesses or
countesses with whose affections your English voyagers are apt to
invest themselves, I beg leave to tell you that my goddess is only
the wife of a 'Merchant of Venice;' but then she is pretty as an
antelope, is but two-and-twenty years old, has the large, black,
oriental eyes, with the Italian countenance, and dark glossy hair,
of the curl and colour of Lady J * *'s. Then she has the voice of a
lute, and the song of a seraph (though not quite so sacred),
besides a long postscript of graces, virtues, and accomplishments,
enough to furnish out a new chapter for Solomon's Song. But her
great<span class="pagenum"><a id="page324" name="page324"></a>Pg 324</span> merit is finding out mine&mdash;there is nothing so amiable as
discernment.</p>

<p>"The general race of women appear to be handsome; but in Italy, as
on almost all the Continent, the highest orders are by no means a
well-looking generation, and indeed reckoned by their countrymen
very much otherwise. Some are exceptions, but most of them as ugly
as Virtue herself.</p>

<p>"If you write, address to me here, <i>poste restante</i>, as I shall
probably stay the winter over. I never see a newspaper, and know
nothing of England, except in a letter now and then from my sister.
Of the MS. sent you, I know nothing, except that you have received
it, and are to publish it, &amp;c. &amp;c.: but when, where, and how, you
leave me to guess; but it don't much matter.</p>

for next year? When does Moore's poem appear? I sent a letter for
him, addressed to your care, the other day."</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER 255. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, December 4, 1816.</p>

<p>"I have written to you so frequently of late, that you will think
me a bore; as I think you a very impolite person, for not answering
my letters from Switzerland, Milan, Verona, and Venice. There are
some things I wanted, and want, to know, viz. whether Mr. Davies,
of inaccurate memory, had or had not delivered the MS. as delivered
to him; because, if he has not, you will find that he will
boun<span class="pagenum"><a id="page325" name="page325"></a>Pg 325</span>tifully bestow transcriptions on all the curious of his
acquaintance, in which case you may probably find your publication
anticipated by the 'Cambridge' or other Chronicles. In the next
place,&mdash;I forget what was next; but in the third place, I want to
hear whether you have yet published, or when you mean to do so, or
why you have not done so, because in your last (Sept. 20th,&mdash;you
may be ashamed of the date), you talked of this being done
immediately.</p>

<p>"From England I hear nothing, and know nothing of any thing or any
body. I have but one correspondent (except Mr. Kinnaird on business
now and then), and her a female; so that I know no more of your
island, or city, than the Italian version of the French papers
chooses to tell me, or the advertisements of Mr. Colburn tagged to
the end of your Quarterly Review for the year <i>ago</i>. I wrote to you
at some length last week, and have little to add, except that I
have begun, and am proceeding in, a study of the Armenian language,
which I acquire, as well as I can, at the Armenian convent, where I
go every day to take lessons of a learned friar, and have gained
some singular and not useless information with regard to the
literature and customs of that oriental people. They have an
establishment here&mdash;a church and convent of ninety monks, very
learned and accomplished men, some of them. They have also a press,
and make great efforts for the enlightening of their nation. I find
the language (which is <i>twin</i>, the <i>literal</i> and the <i>vulgar</i>)
difficult, but not invincible (at least I hope not). I shall go on.
I found it necessary to twist my<span class="pagenum"><a id="page326" name="page326"></a>Pg 326</span> mind round some severer study,
and this, as being the hardest I could devise here, will be a file
for the serpent.</p>

<p>"I mean to remain here till the spring, so address to me <i>directly</i>
to <i>Venice, poste restante</i>.&mdash;Mr. Hobhouse, for the present, is
gone to Rome, with his brother, brother's wife, and sister, who
overtook him here: he returns in two months. I should have gone
too, but I fell in love, and must stay that over. I should think
<i>that</i> and the Armenian alphabet will last the winter. The lady
has, luckily for me, been less obdurate than the language, or,
between the two, I should have lost my remains of sanity. By the
way, she is not an Armenian but a Venetian, as I believe I told you
in my last. As for Italian, I am fluent enough, even in its
Venetian modification, which is something like the Somersetshire
version of English; and as for the more classical dialects, I had
not forgot my former practice much during my voyaging.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, Dec. 9. 1816.</p>

<p>"In a letter from England, I am informed that a man named Johnson
has taken upon himself to publish some poems called a 'Pilgrimage
to Jerusalem, a Tempest, and an Address to my Daughter,' &amp;c., and
to attribute them to me, adding that he had paid five<span class="pagenum"><a id="page327" name="page327"></a>Pg 327</span> hundred
guineas for them. The answer to this is short: <i>I never wrote such
poems, never received the sum he mentions, nor any other in the
same quarter, nor</i> (as far as moral or mortal certainty can be
sure) <i>ever had, directly or indirectly, the slightest
communication with Johnson in my life</i>; not being aware that the
person existed till this intelligence gave me to understand that
there were such people. Nothing surprises me, or this perhaps
<i>would</i>, and most things amuse me, or this probably would <i>not</i>.
With regard to myself, the man has merely <i>lied</i>; that's natural;
his betters have set him the example. But with regard to you, his
assertion may perhaps injure you in your publications; and I desire
that it may receive the most public and unqualified contradiction.
I do not know that there is any punishment for a thing of this
kind, and if there were, I should not feel disposed to pursue this
ingenious mountebank farther than was necessary for his
confutation; but thus far it may be necessary to proceed.</p>

<p>"You will make what use you please of this letter; and Mr.
Kinnaird, who has power to act for me in my absence, will, I am
sure, readily join you in any steps which it may be proper to take
with regard to the absurd falsehood of this poor creature. As you
will have recently received several letters from me on my way to
Venice, as well as two written since my arrival, I will not at
present trouble you further.</p>

that I consider myself responsible for no publication from the year
1812 up to the present date which is not from your press. I speak
of course from that period, because, previously, Cawthorn and Ridge
had both printed compositions of mine. 'A Pilgrimage to Jerusalem!'
How the devil should I write about <i>Jerusalem</i>, never having yet
been there? As for 'A Tempest,' it was <i>not</i> a <i>tempest</i> when I
left England, but a very fresh breeze: and as to an 'Address to
little Ada,' (who, by the way, is a year old to-morrow,) I never
wrote a line about her, except in 'Farewell' and the third Canto of
Childe Harold."</p></div>

a Paduan and Venetian party, and afterwards went to the opera, at
the Fenice theatre (which opens for the Carnival on that day),&mdash;the
finest, by the way, I have ever seen: it beats our theatres hollow
in beauty and scenery, and those of Milan and Brescia bow before
it. The opera and its sirens were much like other operas and women,
but the subject of the said opera was something edifying; it
turned&mdash;the plot and conduct thereof&mdash;upon a fact narrated by Livy
of a hundred and fifty married ladies having poisoned a hundred and
fifty husbands in good old times. The bachelors of Rome believed
this extraordinary mortality to be merely the common effect of
matrimony or a pestilence; but the surviving Benedicts, being all
seized with the cholic, examined into the matter, and found that
'their possets had been drugged;' the consequence of which was,
much scandal and several suits at law. This is really and truly the
subject of the musical piece at the Fenice; and you can't conceive
what pretty things are sung and recitativoed about the <i>horrenda
strage</i>. The conclusion was a lady's head about to be chopped off
by a lictor, but (I am sorry to say) he left it on, and she got up
and sung a trio with the two Consuls, the Senate in the back-ground
being chorus. The ballet was distinguished by nothing remarkable,
except that the principal she-dancer went into convulsions because
she was not applauded on her first appearance; and the manager came
forward to ask if there was 'ever a physician in the theatre.'
There was a Greek one in my box, whom I wished very much to
volunteer his services, being sure that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330"></a>Pg 330</span> in this case these would
have been the last convulsions which would have troubled the
ballarina; but he would not. The crowd was enormous, and in coming
out, having a lady under my arm, I was obliged, in making way,
almost to 'beat a Venetian and traduce the state,' being compelled
to regale a person with an English punch in the guts, which sent
him as far back as the squeeze and the passage would admit. He did
not ask for another, but, with great signs of disapprobation and
dismay, appealed to his compatriots, who laughed at him.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 258. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, Jan. 2. 1817.</p>

<p>"Your letter has arrived. Pray, in publishing the third Canto, have
you <i>omitted</i> any passages? I hope <i>not</i>; and indeed wrote to you
on my way over the Alps to prevent such an incident. Say in your
next whether or not the <i>whole</i> of the Canto (as sent to you) has
been published. I wrote to you again the other day, (<i>twice</i>, I
think,) and shall be glad to hear of the reception of those
letters.</p>

<p>"To-day is the 2d of January. On this day <i>three</i> years ago The
Corsair's publication is dated, I think, in my letter to Moore. On
this day <i>two</i> years I married, ('Whom the Lord loveth he
chasteneth,'&mdash;I sha'n't forget the day in a hurry,) and it is odd
enough that I this day received a letter from you announcing the
publication of Childe Harold, &amp;c. &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page332" name="page332"></a>Pg 332</span> on the day of the date of
'The Corsair;' and I also received one from my sister, written on
the 10th of December, my daughter's birth-day (and relative chiefly
to my daughter), and arriving on the day of the date of my
marriage, this present 2d of January, the month of my birth,&mdash;and
various other astrologous matters, which I have no time to
enumerate.</p>

<p>"By the way, you might as well write to Hentsch, my Geneva banker,
and enquire whether the <i>two packets</i> consigned to his care were or
were not delivered to Mr. St. Aubyn, or if they are still in his
keeping. One contains papers, letters, and all the original MS. of
your third Canto, as first conceived; and the other, some bones
from the field of Morat. Many thanks for your news, and the good
spirits in which your letter is written.</p>

<p>"Venice and I agree very well; but I do not know that I have any
thing new to say, except of the last new opera, which I sent in my
late letter. The Carnival is commencing, and there is a good deal
of fun here and there&mdash;besides business; for all the world are
making up their intrigues for the season, changing, or going on
upon a renewed lease. I am very well off with Marianna, who is not
at all a person to tire me; firstly, because I do not tire of a
woman <i>personally</i>, but because they are generally bores in their
disposition; and, secondly, because she is amiable, and has a tact
which is not always the portion of the fair creation; and, thirdly,
she is very pretty; and, fourthly&mdash;but there is no occasion for
further specification. So far we have gone on very well; as to the
future, I never anticipate&mdash;<i>carpe<span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name="page333"></a>Pg 333</span> diem</i>&mdash;the past at least is
one's own, which is one reason for making sure of the present. So
much for my proper <i>liaison</i>.</p>

<p>"The general state of morals here is much the same as in the Doges'
time; a woman is virtuous (according to the code) who limits
herself to her husband and one lover; those who have two, three, or
more, are a little <i>wild</i>; but it is only those who are
indiscriminately diffuse, and form a low connection, such as the
Princess of Wales with her courier, (who, by the way, is made a
knight of Malta,) who are considered as overstepping the modesty of
marriage. In Venice, the nobility have a trick of marrying with
dancers and singers; and, truth to say, the women of their own
order are by no means handsome; but the general race, the women of
the second and other orders, the wives of the merchants, and
proprietors, and untitled gentry, are mostly <i>bel' sangue</i>, and it
is with these that the more amatory connections are usually formed.
There are also instances of stupendous constancy. I know a woman of
fifty who never had but one lover, who dying early, she became
devout, renouncing all but her husband. She piques herself, as may
be presumed, upon this miraculous fidelity, talking of it
occasionally with a species of misplaced morality, which is rather
amusing. There is no convincing a woman here that she is in the
smallest degree deviating from the rule of right or the fitness of
things in having an <i>amoroso</i>. The great sin seems to lie in
concealing it, or having more than one, that is, unless such an<span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334"></a>Pg 334</span>
extension of the prerogative is understood and approved of by the
prior claimant.</p>

<p>"In another sheet, I send you some sheets of a grammar, English and
Armenian, for the use of the Armenians, of which I promoted, and
indeed induced, the publication. (It cost me but a thousand
francs&mdash;French livres.) I still pursue my lessons in the language
without any rapid progress, but advancing a little daily. Padre
Paschal, with some little help from me, as translator of his
Italian into English, is also proceeding in a MS. Grammar for the
<i>English</i> acquisition of Armenian, which will be printed also, when
finished.</p>

<p>"We want to know if there are any Armenian types and letter-press
in England, at Oxford, Cambridge, or elsewhere? You know, I
suppose, that, many years ago, the two Whistons published in
England an original text of a history of Armenia, with their own
Latin translation? Do those types still exist? and where? Pray
enquire among your learned acquaintance.</p>

<p>"When this Grammar (I mean the one now printing) is done, will you
have any objection to take forty or fifty copies, which will not
cost in all above five or ten guineas, and try the curiosity of the
learned with a sale of them? Say yes or no, as you like. I can
assure you that they have some very curious books and MSS., chiefly
translations from Greek originals now lost. They are, besides, a
much respected and learned community, and the study of their
language was taken up with great<span class="pagenum"><a id="page335" name="page335"></a>Pg 335</span> ardour by some literary Frenchmen
in Buonaparte's time.</p>

<p>"I have not done a stitch of poetry since I left Switzerland, and
have not, at present, the <i>estro</i> upon me. The truth is, that you
are <i>afraid</i> of having a <i>fourth</i> Canto <i>before</i> September, and of
another copyright, but I have at present no thoughts of resuming
that poem, nor of beginning any other. If I write, I think of
trying prose, but I dread introducing living people, or
applications which might be made to living people. Perhaps one day
or other I may attempt some work of fancy in prose, descriptive of
Italian manners and of human passions; but at present I am
preoccupied. As for poesy, mine is the <i>dream</i> of the sleeping
passions; when they are awake, I cannot speak their language, only
in their somnambulism, and just now they are not dormant.</p>

<p>"If Mr. Gifford wants <i>carte blanche</i> as to The Siege of Corinth,
he has it, and may do as he likes with it.</p>

<p>"I sent you a letter contradictory of the Cheapside man (who
invented the story you speak of) the other day. My best respects to
Mr. Gifford, and such of my friends as you may see at your house. I
wish you all prosperity and new year's gratulation, and am</p>

<p>"Yours," &amp;c.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>To the Armenian Grammar, mentioned in the foregoing letter, the
following interesting fragment, found among his papers, seems to have
been intended as a Preface:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336"></a>Pg 336</span>"The English reader will probably be surprised to find my name
associated with a work of the present description, and inclined to give
me more credit for my attainments as a linguist than they deserve.</p>

<p>"As I would not willingly be guilty of a deception, I will state, as
shortly as I can, my own share in the compilation, with the motives
which led to it. On my arrival at Venice, in the year 1816, I found my
mind in a state which required study, and study of a nature which should
leave little scope for the imagination, and furnish some difficulty in
the pursuit.</p>

<p>"At this period I was much struck&mdash;in common, I believe, with every
other traveller&mdash;with the society of the Convent of St. Lazarus, which
appears to unite all the advantages of the monastic institution, without
any of its vices.</p>

<p>"The neatness, the comfort, the gentleness, the unaffected devotion, the
accomplishments, and the virtues of the brethren of the order, are well
fitted to strike the man of the world with the conviction that 'there is
another and a better' even in this life.</p>

<p>"These men are the priesthood of an oppressed and a noble nation, which
has partaken of the proscription and bondage of the Jews and of the
Greeks, without the sullenness of the former or the servility of the
latter. This people has attained riches without usury, and all the
honours that can be awarded to slavery without intrigue. But they have
long occupied, nevertheless, a part of 'the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page337" name="page337"></a>Pg 337</span> House of Bondage,' who has
lately multiplied her many mansions. It would be difficult, perhaps, to
find the annals of a nation less stained with crimes than those of the
Armenians, whose virtues have been those of peace, and their vices those
of compulsion. But whatever may have been their destiny&mdash;and it has been
bitter&mdash;whatever it may be in future, their country must ever be one of
the most interesting on the globe; and perhaps their language only
requires to be more studied to become more attractive. If the Scriptures
are rightly understood, it was in Armenia that Paradise was
placed&mdash;Armenia, which has paid as dearly as the descendants of Adam for
that fleeting participation of its soil in the happiness of him who was
created from its dust. It was in Armenia that the flood first abated,
and the dove alighted. But with the disappearance of Paradise itself may
be dated almost the unhappiness of the country; for though long a
powerful kingdom, it was scarcely ever an independent one, and the
satraps of Persia and the pachas of Turkey have alike desolated the
region where God created man in his own image."</p>

<p><b>LETTER 259. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, January 28. 1817.</p>

<p>"Your letter of the 8th is before me. The remedy for your plethora
is simple&mdash;abstinence. I was obliged to have recourse to the like
some years ago, I mean in point of <i>diet</i>, and, with the exception
of some convivial weeks and days, (it might be<span class="pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338"></a>Pg 338</span> months, now and
then,) have kept to Pythagoras ever since. For all this, let me
hear that you are better. You must not <i>indulge</i> in 'filthy
beer,' nor in porter, nor eat <i>suppers</i>&mdash;the last are the devil to
those who swallow dinner.</p>

<p>"I am truly sorry to hear of your father's misfortune&mdash;cruel at any
time, but doubly cruel in advanced life. However, you will, at
least, have the satisfaction of doing your part by him, and depend
upon it, it will not be in vain. Fortune, to be sure, is a female,
but not such a b * * as the rest (always excepting your wife and my
sister from such sweeping terms); for she generally has some
justice in the long run. I have no spite against her, though
between her and Nemesis I have had some sore gauntlets to run&mdash;but
then I have done my best to deserve no better. But to <i>you</i>, she is
a good deal in arrear, and she will come round&mdash;mind if she don't:
you have the vigour of life, of independence, of talent, spirit,
and character all with you. What you can do for yourself, you have
done and will do; and surely there are some others in the world who
would not be sorry to be of use, if you would allow them to be
useful, or at least attempt it.</p>

<p>"I think of being in England in the spring. If there is a row, by
the sceptre of King Ludd, but I'll be one; and if there is none,
and only a continuance of 'this meek, piping time of peace,' I will
take a cottage a hundred yards to the south of your abode, and
become your neighbour; and we will compose such canticles, and hold
such dialogues, as shall be the terror of the <i>Times</i> (including
the newspaper of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page339" name="page339"></a>Pg 339</span> that name), and the wonder, and honour, and
praise of the Morning Chronicle and posterity.</p>

<p>"I rejoice to hear of your forthcoming in February&mdash;though I
tremble for the 'magnificence' which you attribute to the new
Childe Harold. I am glad you like it; it is a fine indistinct piece
of poetical desolation, and my favourite. I was half mad during the
time of its composition, between metaphysics, mountains, lakes,
love unextinguishable, thoughts unutterable, and the night-mare of
my own delinquencies. I should, many a good day, have blown my
brains out, but for the recollection that it would have given
pleasure to my mother-in-law; and, even <i>then</i>, if I could have
been certain to haunt her&mdash;but I won't dwell upon these trifling
family matters.</p>

<p>"Venice is in the <i>estro</i> of her carnival, and I have been up these
last two nights at the ridotto and the opera, and all that kind of
thing. Now for an adventure. A few days ago a gondolier brought me
a billet without a subscription, intimating a wish on the part of
the writer to meet me either in gondola, or at the island of San
Lazaro, or at a third rendezvous, indicated in the note. 'I know
the country's disposition well'&mdash;in Venice 'they do let Heaven see
those tricks they dare not show,' &amp;c. &amp;c.; so, for all response, I
said that neither of the three places suited me; but that I would
either be at home at ten at night alone, or be at the ridotto at
midnight, where the writer might meet me masked. At ten o'clock I
was at home and alone (Marianna was gone with her husband to a
conversazione), when the door of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="page340" name="page340"></a>Pg 340</span> apartment opened, and in
walked a well-looking and (for an Italian) <i>bionda</i> girl of about
nineteen, who informed me that she was married to the brother of my
<i>amorosa</i>, and wished to have some conversation with me. I made a
decent reply, and we had some talk in Italian and Romaic (her
mother being a Greek of Corfu), when lo! in a very few minutes in
marches, to my very great astonishment, Marianna S * *, <i>in propri&acirc;
person&acirc;</i>, and after making a most polite courtesy to her
sister-in-law and to me, without a single word seizes her said
sister-in-law by the hair, and bestows upon her some sixteen slaps,
which would have made your ear ache only to hear their echo. I need
not describe the screaming which ensued. The luckless visiter took
flight. I seized Marianna, who, after several vain efforts to get
away in pursuit of the enemy, fairly went into fits in my arms;
and, in spite of reasoning, eau de Cologne, vinegar, half a pint of
water, and God knows what other waters beside, continued so till
past midnight.</p>

<p>"After damning my servants for letting people in without apprizing
me, I found that Marianna in the morning had seen her
sister-in-law's gondolier on the stairs, and, suspecting that his
apparition boded her no good, had either returned of her own
accord, or been followed by her maids or some other spy of her
people to the conversazione, from whence she returned to perpetrate
this piece of pugilism. I had seen fits before, and also some small
scenery of the same genus in and out of our island: but this was
not all. After about an hour, in comes&mdash;who? why, Signor S * *, her
lord and husband, and finds me<span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341"></a>Pg 341</span> with his wife fainting upon a sofa,
and all the apparatus of confusion, dishevelled hair, hats,
handkerchiefs, salts, smelling bottles&mdash;and the lady as pale as
ashes, without sense or motion. His first question was, 'What is
all this?' The lady could not reply&mdash;so I did. I told him the
explanation was the easiest thing in the world; but in the mean
time it would be as well to recover his wife&mdash;at least, her senses.
This came about in due time of suspiration and respiration.</p>

<p>"You need not be alarmed&mdash;jealousy is not the order of the day in
Venice, and daggers are out of fashion, while duels, on love
matters, are unknown&mdash;at least, with the husbands. But, for all
this, it was an awkward affair; and though he must have known that
I made love to Marianna, yet I believe he was not, till that
evening, aware of the extent to which it had gone. It is very well
known that almost all the married women have a lover; but it is
usual to keep up the forms, as in other nations. I did not,
therefore, know what the devil to say. I could not out with the
truth, out of regard to her, and I did not choose to lie for my
sake;&mdash;besides, the thing told itself. I thought the best way would
be to let her explain it as she chose (a woman being never at a
loss&mdash;the devil always sticks by them)&mdash;only determining to protect
and carry her off, in case of any ferocity on the part of the
Signor. I saw that he was quite calm. She went to bed, and next
day&mdash;how they settled it, I know not, but settle it they did.
Well&mdash;then I had to explain to Marianna about this
never-to-be-sufficiently-confounded sister-<span class="pagenum"><a id="page342" name="page342"></a>Pg 342</span>in-law; which I did by
swearing innocence, eternal constancy, &amp;c. &amp;c. But the
sister-in-law, very much discomposed with being treated in such
wise, has (not having her own shame before her eyes) told the
affair to half Venice, and the servants (who were summoned by the
fight and the fainting) to the other half. But, here, nobody minds
such trifles, except to be amused by them. I don't know whether you
will be so, but I have scrawled a long letter out of these follies.</p>

<p>"I have been requested by the Countess Albrizzi here to present her
with 'the Works;' and wish you therefore to send me a copy, that I
may comply with her requisition. You may include the last
published, of which I have seen and know nothing, but from your
letter of the 13th of December.</p>

of your government friends to some of the Portuguese settlers? He
understands his profession well, and has no want of general
talents; his faults are the faults of a pardonable vanity and
youth. His remaining with me was out of the question: I have enough
to do to manage my own scrapes; and as precepts without example are
not the most gracious homilies, I thought it better to give him his
cong&eacute;: but I know no great harm of him, and some good. He is clever
and accomplished; knows his profession, by all accounts, well; and
is honourable in his dealings, and not at all malevolent. I think,
with luck, he will turn out a useful member of society (from which
he will lop the diseased members) and the College of Physicians. If
you can be of any use to him, or know any one who can, pray be so,
as he has his fortune to make. He has kept a <i>medical journal</i>
under the eye of <i>Vacca</i> (the first surgeon on the Continent) at
Pisa: Vacca has corrected it, and it must contain some valuable
hints or information on the practice of this country. If you can
aid him in publishing this also, by your influence with your
brethren, do; I do not ask you to publish it yourself, because that
sort of request is too personal and embarrassing. He has also a
tragedy, of which, having seen nothing, I say nothing: but the very
circumstance of his having made these efforts (if they are only
efforts), at one-and-twenty, is in his favour, and proves him to
have good dispositions for his own improvement. So if, in the way
of commendation or recommendation, you can aid his objects with
your government friends, I wish you would,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page344" name="page344"></a>Pg 344</span> I should think some of

morals, habits, and even <i>politics</i>; and therefore I feel in a very
awkward situation between the two, Mr. Gifford and my friend
Hobhouse, and can only wish that they had no difference, or that
such as they have were accommodated. The Answer I have not seen,

these Spirits, which appear to him, and are of no use; he at last

to evocate a ghost, which appears, and gives him an ambiguous and
disagreeable answer; and in the third act he is found by his
attendants dying in a tower where he had studied his art. You may
perceive by this outline that I have no great opinion of this piece
of fantasy; but I have at least rendered it <i>quite impossible</i> for
the stage, for which my intercourse with Drury Lane has given me
the greatest contempt.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 262. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, February 25. 1817.</p>

<p>"I wrote to you the other day in answer to your letter; at present
I would trouble you with a commission, if you would be kind enough
to undertake it.</p>

<p>"You, perhaps, know Mr. Love, the jeweller, of Old Bond Street? In
1813, when in the intention of returning to Turkey, I purchased of
him, and paid (<i>argent comptant</i>) for about a dozen snuff-boxes, of
more or less value, as presents for some of my Mussulman
acquaintance. These I have now with me. The other day, having
occasion to make an alteration in the lid of one (to place a
portrait in it), it has turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="page347" name="page347"></a>Pg 347</span> out to be <i>silver-gilt</i> instead of
<i>gold</i>, for which last it was sold and paid for. This was
discovered by the workman in trying it, before taking off the
hinges and working upon the lid. I have of course recalled and
preserved the box <i>in statu quo</i>. What I wish you to do is, to see
the said Mr. Love, and inform him of this circumstance, adding,
from me, that I will take care he shall not have done this with
impunity.</p>

<p>"If there is no remedy in law, there is at least the equitable one
of making known his <i>guilt</i>,&mdash;that is, his silver-<i>gilt</i>, and be
d&mdash;&mdash;d to him.</p>

<p>"I shall carefully preserve all the purchases I made of him on that
occasion for my return, as the plague in Turkey is a barrier to
travelling there at present, or rather the endless quarantine which
would be the consequence before one could land in coming back. Pray
state the matter to him with due ferocity.</p>

<p>"I sent you the other day some extracts from a kind of Drama which
I had begun in Switzerland and finished here; you will tell me if
they are received. They were only in a letter. I have not yet had
energy to copy it out, or I would send you the whole in different
covers.</p>

<p>"The Carnival closed this day last week.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hobhouse is still at Rome, I believe. I am at present a little
unwell;&mdash;sitting up too late and some subsidiary dissipations have
lowered my blood a good deal; but I have at present the quiet and
temperance of Lent before me.</p>

<p>"Believe me, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page348" name="page348"></a>Pg 348</span>"P.S. Remember me to Mr. Gifford&mdash;I have not received your parcel
or parcels.&mdash;Look into 'Moore's (Dr. Moore's) View of Italy' for
me; in one of the volumes you will find an account of the <i>Doge
Valiere</i> (it ought to be Falieri) and his conspiracy, or the
motives of it. Get it transcribed for me, and send it in a letter
to me soon. I want it, and cannot find so good an account of that
business here; though the veiled patriot, and the place where he
was crowned, and afterwards decapitated, still exist and are shown.
I have searched all their histories; but the policy of the old
aristocracy made their writers silent on his motives, which were a
private grievance against one of the patricians.</p>

<p>"I mean to write a tragedy on the subject, which appears to me very
dramatic; an old man, jealous, and conspiring against the state of
which he was the actually reigning chief. The last circumstance
makes it the most remarkable and only fact of the kind in all
history of all nations."</p></div>

more than usual, because your last indicated that you were unwell.
At present, I am on the invalid regimen myself. The Carnival&mdash;that

all its abstinence and sacred music.</p>

<p>I have lately had some news of litter<i>atoor</i>, as I heard the editor
of the Monthly pronounce it once upon a time. I hear that W.W. has
been publishing and responding to the attacks of the Quarterly, in
the learned Perry's Chronicle. I read his poesies last autumn, and,
amongst them, found an epitaph on his bull-dog, and another on
<i>myself</i>. But I beg leave to assure him (like the astrologer
Partridge) that I am not only alive now, but was alive also at the
time he wrote it. Hobhouse has (I hear, also) expectorated a letter
against the Quarterly, addressed to me. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page350" name="page350"></a>Pg 350</span> feel awkwardly situated
between him and Gifford, both being my friends.</p>

<p>"And this is your month of going to press&mdash;by the body of Diana! (a
Venetian oath,) I feel as anxious&mdash;but not fearful for you&mdash;as if
it were myself coming out in a work of humour, which would, you
know, be the antipodes of all my previous publications. I don't
think you have any thing to dread but your own reputation. You must
keep up to that. As you never showed me a line of your work, I do
not even know your measure; but you must send me a copy by Murray
forthwith, and then you shall hear what I think. I dare say you are
in a pucker. Of all authors, you are the only really <i>modest</i> one I
ever met with,&mdash;which would sound oddly enough to those who
recollect your morals when you were young&mdash;that is, when you were
<i>extremely</i> young&mdash;don't mean to stigmatise you either with years
or morality.</p>

<p>"I believe I told you that the E.R. had attacked me, in an article
on Coleridge (I have not seen it)&mdash;'<i>Et tu</i>, Jeffrey?'&mdash;'there is
nothing but roguery in villanous man.' But I absolve him of all
attacks, present and future; for I think he had already pushed his
clemency in my behoof to the utmost, and I shall always think well
of him. I only wonder he did not begin before, as my domestic
destruction was a fine opening for all the world, of which all who
could did well to avail themselves.</p>

<p>"If I live ten years longer, you will see, however, that it is not
over with me&mdash;I don't mean in literature, for that is nothing; and
it may seem odd enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="page351" name="page351"></a>Pg 351</span> to say, I do not think it my vocation. But
you will see that I shall do something or other&mdash;the times and
fortune permitting&mdash;that, 'like the cosmogony, or creation of the
world, will puzzle the philosophers of all ages.' But I doubt
whether my constitution will hold out. I have, at intervals,
ex<i>or</i>cised it most devilishly.</p>

<p>"I have not yet fixed a time of return, but I think of the spring.
I shall have been away a year in April next. You never mention
Rogers, nor Hodgson, your clerical neighbour, who has lately got a
living near you. Has he also got a child yet?&mdash;his desideratum,
when I saw him last.</p>

ever and truly and affectionately," &amp;c.</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER 264. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, March 3. 1817.</p>

<p>"In acknowledging the arrival of the article from the
'Quarterly<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>,' which I received two days ago, I cannot express
myself better than in the words of my sister Augusta, who (speaking
of it) says, that it is written in a spirit 'of the most feeling
and kind nature.' It is, however, something more; it seems to me
(as far as the subject of it may be permitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="page352" name="page352"></a>Pg 352</span> to judge) to be
<i>very well</i> written as a composition, and I think will do the
journal no discredit, because even those who condemn its partiality
must praise its generosity. The temptations to take another and a
less favourable view of the question have been so great and
numerous, that, what with public opinion, politics, &amp;c. he must be
a gallant as well as a good man, who has ventured in that place,
and at this time, to write such an article even anonymously. Such
things are, however, their own reward; and I even flatter myself
that the writer, whoever he may be (and I have no guess), will not
regret that the perusal of this has given me as much gratification
as any composition of that nature could give, and more than any
other has given,&mdash;and I have had a good many in my time of one kind
or the other. It is not the mere praise, but there is a <i>tact</i> and
a <i>delicacy</i> throughout, not only with regard to me, but to
<i>others</i>, which, as it had not been observed <i>elsewhere</i>, I had
till now doubted whether it could be observed <i>any where</i>.</p>

<p>"Perhaps some day or other you will know or tell me the writer's
name. Be assured, had the article been a harsh one, I should not
have asked it.</p>

<p>"I have lately written to you frequently, with <i>extracts</i>, &amp;c.,
which I hope you have received, or will receive, with or before
this letter.&mdash;Ever since the conclusion of the Carnival I have been
unwell, (do not mention this, on any account, to Mrs. Leigh; for if
I grow worse, she will know it too soon, and if I get better, there
is no occasion that she should know it at all,) and have hardly
stirred out of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page353" name="page353"></a>Pg 353</span> house. However, I don't want a physician, and
if I did, very luckily those of Italy are the worst in the world,
so that I should still have a chance. They have, I believe, one
famous surgeon, Vacca, who lives at Pisa, who might be useful in
case of dissection:&mdash;but he is some hundred miles off. My malady is
a sort of lowish fever, originating from what my 'pastor and
master,' Jackson, would call 'taking too much out of one's self.'
However, I am better within this day or two.</p>

<p>"I missed seeing the new Patriarch's procession to St. Mark's the
other day (owing to my indisposition), with six hundred and fifty
priests in his rear&mdash;a 'goodly army.' The admirable government of
Vienna, in its edict from thence, authorising his installation,
prescribed, as part of the pageant, 'a <i>coach</i> and four horses.' To
show how very, very '<i>German</i> to the matter' this was, you have
only to suppose our parliament commanding the Archbishop of
Canterbury to proceed from Hyde Park Corner to St. Paul's Cathedral
in the Lord Mayor's barge, or the Margate hoy. There is but St.
Mark's Place in all Venice broad enough for a carriage to move, and
it is paved with large smooth flag-stones, so that the chariot and
horses of Elijah himself would be puzzled to manoeuvre upon it.
Those of Pharaoh might do better; for the canals&mdash;and particularly
the Grand Canal&mdash;are sufficiently capacious and extensive for his
whole host. Of course, no coach could be attempted; but the
Venetians, who are very na&iuml;ve as well as arch, were much amused
with the ordinance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page354" name="page354"></a>Pg 354</span>"The Armenian Grammar is published; but my Armenian studies are
suspended for the present till my head aches a little less. I sent
you the other day, in two covers, the first Act of 'Manfred,' a
drama as mad as Nat. Lee's Bedlam tragedy, which was in 25 acts and
some odd scenes:&mdash;mine is but in Three Acts.</p>

must end it, then, at the right.</p>

<p><b>LETTER 265. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, March 9. 1817.</p>

<p>"In remitting the third Act of the sort of dramatic poem of which
you will by this time have received the two first (at least I hope
so), which were sent within the last three weeks, I have little to
observe, except that you must not publish it (if it ever is
published) without giving me previous notice. I have really and
truly no notion whether it is good or bad; and as this was not the
case with the principal of my former publications, I am, therefore,
inclined to rank it very humbly. You will submit it to Mr. Gifford,
and to whomsoever you please besides. With regard to the question
of copyright (if it ever comes to publication), I do not know
whether you would think <i>three hundred</i> guineas an over-estimate;
if you do, you may diminish it: I do not think it worth more; so
you may see I make some difference between it and the others.</p>

<p>"I have received your two Reviews (but not the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page355" name="page355"></a>Pg 355</span> 'Tales of my
Landlord'); the Quarterly I acknowledged particularly to you, on
its arrival, ten days ago. What you tell me of Perry petrifies me;
it is a rank imposition. In or about February or March, 1816, I was
given to understand that Mr. Croker was not only a coadjutor in the
attacks of the Courier in 1814, but the author of some lines
tolerably ferocious, then recently published in a morning paper.
Upon this I wrote a reprisal. The whole of the lines I have
forgotten, and even the purport of them I scarcely remember; for on
<i>your</i> assuring me that he was not, &amp;c. &amp;c., I put them into the
<i>fire before your face</i>, and there <i>never was</i> but that <i>one rough</i>
copy. Mr. Davies, the only person who ever heard them read, wanted
a copy, which I refused. If, however, by some <i>impossibility</i>,
which I cannot divine, the ghost of these rhymes should walk into
the world, I never will deny what I have really written, but hold
myself personally responsible for satisfaction, though I reserve to
myself the right of disavowing all or any <i>fabrications</i>. To the
previous facts you are a witness, and best know how far my
recapitulation is correct; and I request that you will inform Mr.
Perry from me, that I wonder he should permit such an abuse of my
name in his paper; I say an <i>abuse</i>, because my absence, at least,
demands some respect, and my presence and positive sanction could
alone justify him in such a proceeding, even were the lines mine;
and if false, there are no words for him. I repeat to you that the
original was burnt before you on your <i>assurance</i>, and there
<i>never</i> was a <i>copy</i>, nor even a verbal repetition,&mdash;very much to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page356" name="page356"></a>Pg 356</span>
the discomfort of some zealous Whigs, who bored me for them (having
heard it bruited by Mr. Davies that there were such matters) to no
purpose; for, having written them solely with the notion that Mr.
Croker was the aggressor, and for <i>my own</i> and not party reprisals,
I would not lend me to the zeal of any sect when I was made aware
that he was not the writer of the offensive passages. <i>You know</i>,
if there was such a thing, I would not deny it. I mentioned it
openly at the time to you, and you will remember why and where I
destroyed it; and no power nor wheedling on earth should have made,
or could make, me (if I recollected them) give a copy after that,
unless I was well assured that Mr. Croker was really the author of
that which you assured me he was not.</p>

<p>"I intend for England this spring, where I have some affairs to
adjust; but the post hurries me. For this month past I have been
unwell, but am getting better, and thinking of moving homewards
towards May, without going to Rome, as the unhealthy season comes
on soon, and I can return when I have settled the business I go
upon, which need not be long. I should have thought the Assyrian
tale very succeedable.</p>

<p>"I saw, in Mr. W.W.'s poetry, that he had written my epitaph; I
would rather have written his.</p>

<p>"The thing I have sent you, you will see at a glimpse, could never
be attempted or thought of for the stage; I much doubt it for
publication even. It is too much in my old style; but I composed
it<span class="pagenum"><a id="page357" name="page357"></a>Pg 357</span> actually with a <i>horror</i> of the stage, and with a view to
render the thought of it impracticable, knowing the zeal of my
friends that I should try that for which I have an invincible
repugnance, viz. a representation.</p>

<p>"I certainly am a devil of a mannerist, and must leave off; but
what could I do? Without exertion of some kind, I should have sunk
under my imagination and reality. My best respects to Mr. Gifford,
to Walter Scott, and to all friends.</p>

my private relation to him, as his well-wisher, and it may be one

the rest of the reptiles. But they crossed me every where. I met a

be the least aware of what they saw.</p>

suppose what a Bedlam tragedy it must be: make him show it you. I
sent him all three acts piece-meal, by the post, and suppose they
have arrived.</p>

<p>"I have now written to you at least six letters, or lettered, and
all I have received in return is a note about the length you used
to write from Bury Street to St. James's Street, when we used to
dine with Rogers, and talk laxly, and go to parties, and hear poor
Sheridan now and then. Do you remember one night he was so tipsy
that I was forced to put his cocked hat on for him,&mdash;for he could
not,&mdash;and I let him down at Brookes's, much as he must since have
been let down into his grave. Heigh ho! I wish I was drunk&mdash;but I
have nothing but this d&mdash;&mdash;d barley-water before me.</p>

<p>"I am still in love,&mdash;which is a dreadful drawback in quitting a
place, and I can't stay at Venice much longer. What I shall do on
this point I don't know. The girl means to go with me, but I do not
like this for her own sake. I have had so many conflicts in my own
mind on this subject, that I am not at all sure they did not help
me to the fever I mentioned above. I am certainly very much
attached to her, and I have cause to be so, if you knew all. But
she has a child; and though, like all the 'children of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page363" name="page363"></a>Pg 363</span> sun,'
she consults nothing but passion, it is necessary I should think
for both; and it is only the virtuous, like * * * *, who can afford
to give up husband and child, and live happy ever after.</p>

<p>"The Italian ethics are the most singular ever met with. The
perversion, not only of action, but of reasoning, is singular in
the women. It is not that they do not consider the thing itself as
wrong, and very wrong, but <i>love</i> (the <i>sentiment</i> of love) is not
merely an excuse for it, but makes it an <i>actual virtue</i>, provided
it is disinterested, and not a <i>caprice</i>, and is confined to one
object. They have awful notions of constancy; for I have seen some
ancient figures of eighty pointed out as amorosi of forty, fifty,
and sixty years' standing. I can't say I have ever seen a husband
and wife so coupled.</p>

<p>"Ever, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. Marianna, to whom I have just translated what I have written
on our subject to you, says&mdash;'If you loved me thoroughly, you would
not make so many fine reflections, which are only good <i>forbirsi i
scarpi</i>,'&mdash;that is, 'to clean shoes withal,'&mdash;a Venetian proverb of
appreciation, which is applicable to reasoning of all kinds."</p></div>

<p><b>LETTER 268. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, March 25. 1817.</p>

<p>"Your letter and enclosure are safe; but 'English gentlemen' are
very rare&mdash;at least in Venice. I doubt whether there are at present
any, save, the consul and vice-consul, with neither of whom I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page364" name="page364"></a>Pg 364</span>
the slightest acquaintance. The moment I can pounce upon a witness,
I will send the deed properly signed: but must he necessarily be
genteel? Venice is not a place where the English are gregarious;
their pigeon-houses are Florence, Naples, Rome, &amp;c.; and to tell
you the truth, this was one reason why I stayed here till the
season of the purgation of Rome from these people, which is
infected with them at this time, should arrive. Besides, I abhor
the nation and the nation me; it is impossible for me to describe
my <i>own</i> sensation on that point, but it may suffice to say, that,
if I met with any of the race in the beautiful parts of
Switzerland, the most distant glimpse or aspect of them poisoned
the whole scene, and I do not choose to have the Pantheon, and St.
Peter's, and the Capitol, spoiled for me too. This feeling may be
probably owing to recent events; but it does not exist the less,
and while it exists, I shall conceal it as little as any other.</p>

<p>"I have been seriously ill with a fever, but it is gone. I believe
or suppose it was the indigenous fever of the place, which comes
every year at this time, and of which the physicians change the
name annually, to despatch the people sooner. It is a kind of
typhus, and kills occasionally. It was pretty smart, but nothing
particular, and has left me some debility and a great appetite.
There are a good many ill at present, I suppose, of the same.</p>

<p>"I feel sorry for Horner, if there was any thing in the world to
make him like it; and still more sorry for his friends, as there
was much to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="page365" name="page365"></a>Pg 365</span> them regret him. I had not heard of his death
till by your letter.</p>

<p>"Some weeks ago I wrote to you my acknowledgments of Walter Scott's
article. Now I know it to be his, it cannot add to my good opinion
of him, but it adds to that of myself. <i>He</i>, and Gifford, and
Moore, are the only <i>regulars</i> I ever knew who had nothing of the
<i>garrison</i> about their manner: no nonsense, nor affectations, look
you! As for the rest whom I have known, there was always more or
less of the author about them&mdash;the pen peeping from behind the ear,
and the thumbs a little inky, or so.</p>

<p>"'Lalla Rookh'&mdash;you must recollect that, in the way of title, the
'<i>Giaour</i>' has never been pronounced to this day; and both it and
Childe Harold sounded very facetious to the blue-bottles of wit and
humour about town, till they were taught and startled into a proper
deportment; and therefore Lalla Rookh, which is very orthodox and
oriental, is as good a title as need be, if not better. I could
wish rather that he had not called it '<i>a Persian Tale</i>;' firstly,
because we have had Turkish Tales, and Hindoo Tales, and Assyrian
Tales, already; and <i>tale</i> is a word of which it repents me to have
nicknamed poesy. 'Fable' would be better; and, secondly, 'Persian
Tale' reminds one of the lines of Pope on Ambrose Phillips; though
no one can say, to be sure, that this tale has been 'turned for
half-a-crown;' still it is as well to avoid such clashings.
'Persian Story'&mdash;why not?&mdash;or Romance? I feel as anxious for Moore
as I could do for myself, for the soul of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page366" name="page366"></a>Pg 366</span> me, and I would not have
him succeed otherwise than splendidly, which I trust he will do.</p>

<p>"With regard to the 'Witch Drama,' I sent all the three acts by
post, week after week, within this last month. I repeat that I have
not an idea if it is good or bad. If bad, it must, on no account,
be risked in publication; if good, it is at your service I value it
at <i>three hundred</i> guineas, or less, if you like it. Perhaps, if
published, the best way will be to add it to your winter volume,
and not publish separately. The price will show you I don't pique
myself upon it; so speak out. You may put it in the fire, if you
like, and Gifford don't like.</p>

<p>"The Armenian Grammar is published&mdash;that is, <i>one</i>; the other is
still in MS. My illness has prevented me from moving this month
past, and I have done nothing more with the Armenian.</p>

<p>"Of Italian or rather Lombard manners, I could tell you little or
nothing: I went two or three times to the governor's conversazione,
(and if you go once, you are free to go always,) at which, as I
only saw very plain women, a formal circle, in short a <i>worst sort</i>
of rout, I did not go again. I went to Academie and to Madame
Albrizzi's, where I saw pretty much the same thing, with the
addition of some literati, who are the same <i>blue</i><a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>, by &mdash;&mdash;,
all the world over. I fell in love the first week with Madame * *,
and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page367" name="page367"></a>Pg 367</span> have continued so ever since, because she is very pretty and
pleasing, and talks Venetian, which amuses me, and is na&iuml;ve.</p>

<p>"Very truly, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. Pray send the red tooth-powder by a <i>safe hand</i>, and
speedily.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p><b>LETTER 269. TO MR. MOORE.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, March 31. 1817.</p>

<p>"You will begin to think my epistolary offerings (to whatever altar
you please to devote them) rather prodigal. But until you answer, I
shall not abate, because you deserve no better. I know you are
well, because I hear of your voyaging to London and the environs,
which I rejoice to learn, because your note alarmed me by the
purgation and phlebotomy therein prognosticated. I also hear of
your being in the press; all which, methinks, might have furnished
you with subject-matter for a middle-sized letter, considering that
I am in foreign parts, and that the last month's advertisements and
obituary would be absolute news to me from your Tramontane country.</p>

<p>"I told you, in my last, I have had a smart fever. There is an
epidemic in the place; but I suspect, from the symptoms, that mine
was a fever of my own, and had nothing in common with the low,
vulgar typhus, which is at this moment decimating Venice, and which
has half unpeopled Milan, if the accounts be true. This malady has
sorely discomfited my serving men, who want sadly to be gone away,
and get me to remove. But, besides my natural perversity, I was
seasoned in Turkey, by the continual whispers of the plague,
against apprehensions of contagion. Besides which, apprehension
would not prevent it; and then I am still in love, and 'forty
thousand' fevers should not make me stir before my minute, while
under the influence of that paramount<span class="pagenum"><a id="page369" name="page369"></a>Pg 369</span> delirium. Seriously
speaking, there is a malady rife in the city&mdash;a dangerous one, they
say. However, mine did not appear so, though it was not pleasant.</p>

<p>"This is Passion-week&mdash;and twilight&mdash;and all the world are at
vespers. They have an eternal churching, as in all Catholic
countries, but are not so bigoted as they seem to be in Spain.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether to be glad or sorry that you are leaving
Mayfield. Had I ever been at Newstead during your stay there,
(except during the winter of 1813-14, when the roads were
impracticable,) we should have been within hail, and I should like
to have made a giro of the Peak with you. I know that country well,
having been all over it when a boy. Was you ever in Dovedale? I can
assure you there are things in Derbyshire as noble as Greece or
Switzerland. But you had always a lingering after London, and I
don't wonder at it. I liked it as well as any body, myself, now and
then.</p>

<p>"Will you remember me to Rogers? whom I presume to be flourishing,
and whom I regard as our poetical papa. You are his lawful son, and
I the illegitimate. Has he begun yet upon Sheridan? If you see our
republican friend, Leigh Hunt, pray present my remembrances. I saw
about nine months ago that he was in a row (like my friend
Hobhouse) with the Quarterly Reviewers. For my part, I never could
understand these quarrels of authors with critics and with one
another. 'For God's sake, gentlemen, what do they mean?'</p>

<p>"What think you of your countryman, Maturin?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page370" name="page370"></a>Pg 370</span> I take some credit to
myself for having done my best to bring out Bertram; but I must say
my colleagues were quite as ready and willing. Walter Scott,
however, was the <i>first</i> who mentioned him, which he did to me,
with great commendation, in 1815; and it is to this casualty, and
two or three other accidents, that this very clever fellow owed his
first and well-merited public success. What a chance is fame!</p>

<p>"Did I tell you that I have translated two Epistles?&mdash;a
correspondence between St. Paul and the Corinthians, not to be
found in our version, but the Armenian&mdash;but which seems to me very
orthodox, and I have done it into scriptural prose English.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p><b>LETTER 270. TO MR. MURRAY.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, April 2. 1817.</p>

<p>"I sent you the whole of the Drama at <i>three several</i> times, act by
act, in separate covers. I hope that you have, or will receive,
some or the whole of it.</p>

<p>"So Love has a conscience. By Diana! I shall make him take back the
box, though it were Pandora's. The discovery of its intrinsic
silver occurred on sending it to have the lid adapted to admit
Marianna's portrait. Of course I had the box remitted <i>in statu
quo</i>, and had the picture set in another, which suits it (the
picture) very well. The defaulting box is not touched, hardly, and
was not in the man's hands above an hour.</p>

<p>"I am aware of what you say of Otway; and am a very great admirer
of his,&mdash;all except of that maudlin b&mdash;h of chaste lewdness and
blubbering curiosity, Belvidera, whom I utterly despise, abhor, and
detest. But the story of Marino Faliero is different, and, I think,
so much finer, that I wish Otway had taken it instead: the head
conspiring against the body for refusal of redress for a real
injury,&mdash;jealousy&mdash;treason, with the more fixed and inveterate
passions (mixed with policy) of an old or<span class="pagenum"><a id="page372" name="page372"></a>Pg 372</span> elderly man&mdash;the devil
himself could not have a finer subject, and he is your only tragic
dramatist.</p>

<p>"There is still, in the Doge's palace, the black veil painted over
Faliero's picture, and the staircase whereon he was first crowned
Doge, and subsequently decapitated. This was the thing that most
struck my imagination in Venice&mdash;more than the Rialto, which I
visited for the sake of Shylock; and more, too, than Schiller's
'<i>Armenian</i>,' a novel which took a great hold of me when a boy. It
is also called the 'Ghost Seer,' and I never walked down St. Mark's
by moonlight without thinking of it, and 'at nine o'clock he
died!'&mdash;But I hate things <i>all fiction</i>; and therefore the
<i>Merchant</i> and <i>Othello</i> have no great associations to me: but
<i>Pierre</i> has. There should always be some foundation of fact for
the most airy fabric, and pure invention is but the talent of a
liar.</p>

<p>"Maturin's tragedy.&mdash;By your account of him last year to me, he
seemed a bit of a coxcomb, personally. Poor fellow! to be sure, he
had had a long seasoning of adversity, which is not so hard to bear
as t'other thing. I hope that this won't throw him back into the
'slough of Despond.'</p>

<p>"You talk of 'marriage;'&mdash;ever since my own funeral, the word makes
me giddy, and throws me into a cold sweat. Pray, don't repeat it.</p>

<p>"You should close with Madame de Sta&euml;l. This will be her best work,
and permanently historical; it is on her father, the Revolution,
and Buonaparte, &amp;c. Bunstetten told me in Switzerland it was
<i>very</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="page373" name="page373"></a>Pg 373</span> <i>great</i>. I have not seen it myself, but the author often.
She was very kind to me at Copet.</p>

<p>"There have been two articles in the Venice papers, one a Review of
Glenarvon * * * *, and the other a Review of Childe Harold, in
which it proclaims me the most rebellious and contumacious admirer
of Buonaparte now surviving in Europe. Both these articles are
translations from the Literary Gazette of German Jena.</p>

<p>"Tell me that Walter Scott is better. I would not have him ill for
the world. I suppose it was by sympathy that I had my fever at the
same time.</p>

<p>"I joy in the success of your Quarterly, but I must still stick by
the Edinburgh; Jeffrey has done so by me, I must say, through every
thing, and this is more than I deserved from him. I have more than
once acknowledged to you by letter the 'Article' (and articles);
say that you have received the said letters, as I do not otherwise
know what letters arrive. Both Reviews came, but nothing more. M.'s
play and the extract not yet come.</p>

<p>"Write to say whether my Magician has arrived, with all his scenes,
spells, &amp;c. Yours ever, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"It is useless to send to the <i>Foreign Office</i>: nothing arrives to
me by that conveyance. I suppose some zealous clerk thinks it a
Tory duty to prevent it."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><b>LETTER 271. TO MR. ROGERS.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Venice, April 4. 1817.</p>

<p>"It is a considerable time since I wrote to you last, and I hardly
know why I should trouble you<span class="pagenum"><a id="page374" name="page374"></a>Pg 374</span> now, except that I think you will
not be sorry to hear from me now and then. You and I were never
correspondents, but always something better, which is, very good
friends.</p>

<p>"I saw your friend Sharp in Switzerland, or rather in the German
<i>territory</i> (which is and is not Switzerland), and he gave Hobhouse
and me a very good route for the Bernese Alps; however we took
another from a German, and went by Clarens, the Dent de Jamen to
Montbovon, and through Simmenthal to Thoun, and so on to
Lauterbrounn; except that from thence to the Grindelwald, instead
of round about, we went right over the Wengen Alps' very summit,
and being close under the Jungfrau, saw it, its glaciers, and heard
the avalanches in all their glory, having famous weather
there<i>for</i>. We of course went from the Grindelwald over the
Sheidech to Brientz and its lake; past the Reichenbach and all that
mountain road, which reminded me of Albania and &AElig;tolia and Greece,
except that the people here were more civilised and rascally. I do
not think so very much of Chamouni (except the source of the
Arveron, to which we went up to the teeth of the ice, so as to look
into and touch the cavity, against the warning of the guides, only
one of whom would go with us so close,) as of the Jungfrau, and the
Pissevache, and Simplon, which are quite out of all mortal
competition.</p>

<p>"I was at Milan about a moon, and saw Monti and some other living
curiosities, and thence on to Verona, where I did not forget your
story of the assassination during your sojourn there, and brought
away with me some fragments of Juliet's tomb, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page375" name="page375"></a>Pg 375</span> a lively
recollection of the amphitheatre. The Countess Goetz (the
governor's wife here) told me that there is still a ruined castle
of the Montecchi between Verona and Vicenza. I have been at Venice
since November, but shall proceed to Rome shortly. For my deeds
here, are they not written in my letters to the unreplying Thomas
Moore? to him I refer you: he has received them all, and not
answered one.</p>

<p>"Will you remember me to Lord and Lady Holland? I have to thank
the former for a book which. I have not yet received, but expect to
reperuse with great pleasure on my return, viz. the 2d edition of
Lope de Vega. I have heard of Moore's forthcoming poem: he cannot
wish himself more success than I wish and augur for him. I have
also heard great things of 'Tales of my Landlord,' but I have not
yet received them; by all accounts they beat even Waverley, &amp;c.,
and are by the same author. Maturin's second tragedy has, it seems,
failed, for which I should think any body would be sorry. My health
was very victorious till within the last month, when I had a fever.
There is a typhus in these parts, but I don't think it was that.
However, I got well without a physician or drugs.</p>

<p>"I forgot to tell you that, last autumn, I furnished Lewis with
'bread and salt' for some days at Diodati, in reward for which
(besides his conversation) he translated 'Goethe's Faust' to me by
word of mouth, and I set him by the ears with Madame de Sta&euml;l about
the slave trade. I am indebted for many and kind courtesies to our
Lady of Copet, and I now<span class="pagenum"><a id="page376" name="page376"></a>Pg 376</span> love her as much as I always did her
works, of which I was and am a great admirer. When are you to begin
with Sheridan? what are you doing, and how do you do? Ever very
truly," &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Immediately on the appearance of The Corsair, (with those
obnoxious verses, "Weep, daughter of a royal line," appended to it,) a
series of attacks, not confined to Lord Byron himself, but aimed also at
all those who had lately become his friends, was commenced in the
Courier and Morning Post, and carried on through the greater part of the
months of February and March. The point selected by these writers, as a
ground of censure on the poet, was one which <i>now</i>, perhaps, even
themselves would agree to class among his claims to praise,&mdash;namely, the
atonement which he had endeavoured to make for the youthful violence of
his Satire by a measure of justice, amiable even in its overflowings, to
every one whom he conceived he had wronged.
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the careless tone in which, here and elsewhere, he
speaks of these assaults, it is evident that they annoyed him;&mdash;an
effect which, in reading them over now, we should be apt to wonder they
could produce, did we not recollect the property which Dryden attributes
to "small wits," in common with certain other small animals:&mdash;

<p>
The following is a specimen of the terms in which these party scribes
could then speak of one of the masters of English song:&mdash;"They might
have slept in oblivion with Lord Carlisle's Dramas and Lord Byron's
Poems."&mdash;"Some certainly extol Lord Byron's Poem much, but most of the
best judges place his Lordship rather low in the list of our minor
poets."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> This ancient housemaid, of whose gaunt and witch-like
appearance it would be impossible to convey any idea but by the pencil,
furnished one among the numerous instances of Lord Byron's proneness to
attach himself to any thing, however homely, that had once enlisted his
good nature in its behalf, and become associated with his thoughts. He
first found this old woman at his lodgings in Bennet Street, where, for
a whole season, she was the perpetual scarecrow of his visiters. When,
next year, he took chambers in Albany, one of the great advantages which
his friends looked to in the change was, that they should get rid of
this phantom. But, no,&mdash;there she was again&mdash;he had actually brought her
with him from Bennet Street. The following year saw him married, and,
with a regular establishment of servants, in Piccadilly; and here,&mdash;as
Mrs. Mule had not made her appearance to any of the visiters,&mdash;it was
concluded, rashly, that the witch had vanished. One of those friends,
however, who had most fondly indulged in this persuasion, happening to
call one day when all the male part of the establishment were abroad,
saw, to his dismay, the door opened by the same grim personage, improved
considerably in point of habiliments since he last saw her, and keeping
pace with the increased scale of her master's household, as a new
peruke, and other symptoms of promotion, testified. When asked "how he
came to carry this old woman about with him from place to place," Lord
Byron's only answer was, "The poor old devil was so kind to me."</p></div>

Mr. Dallas, who thus describes the manner in which the gift was
bestowed:&mdash;"On the 28th of December, I called in the morning on Lord
Byron, whom I found composing 'The Corsair.' He had been working upon it
but a few days, and he read me the portion he had written. After some
observations, he said, 'I have a great mind&mdash;I will.' He then added that
he should finish it soon, and asked me to accept of the copyright. I was
much surprised. He had, before he was aware of the value of his works,
declared that he never would take money for them, and that I should have
the whole advantage of all he wrote. This declaration became morally
void when the question was about thousands, instead of a few hundreds;
and I perfectly agree with the admired and admirable author of Waverley,
that 'the wise and good accept not gifts which are made in heat of
blood, and which may be after repented of.'&mdash;I felt this on the sale of
'Childe Harold,' and observed it to him. The copyright of 'The Giaour'
and 'The Bride of Abydos' remained undisposed of, though the poems were
selling rapidly, nor had I the slightest notion that he would ever again
give me a copyright. But as he continued in the resolution of not
appropriating the sale of his works to his own use, I did not scruple to
accept that of 'The Corsair,' and I thanked him. He asked me to call and
hear the portions read as he wrote them. I went every morning, and was
astonished at the rapidity of his composition. He gave me the poem
complete on New-year's day, 1814, saying, that my acceptance of it gave
him great pleasure, and that I was fully at liberty to publish it with
any bookseller I pleased, independent of the profit."

"My dear Moore,
</p><p>
"I had written to you a long letter of dedication, which I
suppress, because, though it contained something relating to you
which every one had been glad to hear, yet there was too much about
politics, and poesy, and all things whatsoever, ending with that
topic on which most men are fluent, and none very amusing&mdash;<i>one's
self</i>. It might have been re-written&mdash;but to what purpose? My
praise could add nothing to your well-earned and firmly-established
fame; and with my most hearty admiration of your talents, and
delight in your conversation, you are already acquainted. In
availing myself of your friendly permission to inscribe this poem
to you, I can only wish the offering were as worthy your acceptance
as your regard is dear to,
</p><p>
"Yours, most affectionately and faithfully,
</p><p>
"BYRON."</p></div>

were vented not only in these notes, but frequently on the proof-sheets
themselves. Thus, a passage in the dedication having been printed "the
first of her bands in estimation," he writes in the margin, "bards, not
bands&mdash;was there ever such a stupid misprint?" and, in correcting a line
that had been curtailed of its due number of syllables, he says, "Do
<i>not</i> omit words&mdash;it is quite enough to alter or mis-spell them."</p></div>

increased to its present length having occupied, as we have seen, a much
longer period. The Corsair, on the contrary, was, from beginning to end,
struck off at a heat&mdash;there being but little alteration or addition
afterwards,&mdash;and the rapidity with which it was produced (being at the
rate of nearly two hundred lines a day) would be altogether incredible,
had we not his own, as well as his publisher's, testimony to the fact.
Such an achievement,&mdash;taking into account the surpassing beauty of the
work,&mdash;is, perhaps, wholly without a parallel in the history of Genius,

all the tyrants that preceded Napoleon have a vigour in them which would
incline me to say that Rosa Matilda is the person&mdash;but then, on the
other hand, that powerful grasp of history," &amp;c. &amp;c. After a little more
of this mock parallel, the letter went on thus:&mdash;"I should like to know
what <i>you</i> think of the matter?&mdash;Some friends of mine here <i>will</i> insist
that it is the work of the author of Childe Harold,&mdash;but then they are
not so well read in F&mdash;&mdash;g&mdash;&mdash;d and Rosa Matilda as I am; and, besides,
they seem to forget that <i>you</i> promised, about a month or two ago, not
to write any more for years. Seriously," &amp;c. &amp;c.

entitled "Buonaparte." In a subsequent note to Mr. Murray, Lord Byron
says,&mdash;"I do not think less highly of 'Buonaparte' for knowing the
author. I was aware that he was a man of talent, but did not suspect him
of possessing <i>all</i> the <i>family</i> talents in such perfection."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> It was the fear of this sort of back-water current to
which so rapid a flow of fame seemed liable, that led some even of his
warmest admirers, ignorant as they were yet of the boundlessness of his
resources, to tremble a little at the frequency of his appearances
before the public. In one of my own letters to him, I find this
apprehension thus expressed:&mdash;"If you did not write so well,&mdash;as the
Royal wit observed,&mdash;I should say you write too much; at least, too much
in the same strain. The Pythagoreans, you know, were of opinion that the
reason why we do not hear or heed the music of the heavenly bodies is
that they are always sounding in our ears; and I fear that even the
influence of <i>your</i> song may be diminished by falling upon the world's
dull ear too constantly."
</p><p>
The opinion, however, which a great writer of our day (himself one of
the few to whom his remark replies) had the generosity, as well as
sagacity, to pronounce on this point, at a time when Lord Byron was
indulging in the fullest lavishment of his powers, must be regarded,
after all, as the most judicious and wise:&mdash;"But they cater ill for the
public," says Sir Walter Scott, "and give indifferent advice to the
poet, supposing him possessed of the highest qualities of his art, who
do not advise him to labour while the laurel around his brows yet
retains its freshness. Sketches from Lord Byron are more valuable than
finished pictures from others; nor are we at all sure that any labour
which he might bestow in revisal would not rather efface than refine
those outlines of striking and powerful originality which they exhibit
when flung rough from the hand of a master."&mdash;<i>Biographical Memoirs</i>, by
SIR W. SCOTT.</p></div>

for Kean, that when Miss O'Neil soon after appeared, and, by her
matchless representation of feminine tenderness, attracted all eyes and
hearts, he was not only a little jealous of her reputation, as
interfering with that of his favourite, but, in order to guard himself
against the risk of becoming a convert, refused to go to see her act. I
endeavoured sometimes to persuade him into witnessing, at least, one of
her performances; but his answer was, (punning upon Shakspeare's word,
"unanealed,") "No&mdash;I'm resolved to continue <i>un-Oneiled</i>."

passage, appears, in Mr. Gifford's hand-writing, on the copy of the
above letter:&mdash;"It is a pity that Lord B. was ignorant of Jonson. The
old poet has a Satire on the Court Pucelle that would have supplied him
with some pleasantry on Johanna's pregnancy."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> On the day of the arrival of the lady's answer, he was
sitting at dinner, when his gardener came in and presented him with his
mother's wedding ring, which she had lost many years before, and which
the gardener had just found in digging up the mould under her window.
Almost at the same moment, the letter from Miss Milbanke arrived; and
Lord Byron exclaimed, "If it contains a consent, I will be married with
this very ring." It did contain a very flattering acceptance of his
proposal, and a duplicate of the letter had been sent to London, in case
this should have missed him.&mdash;<i>Memoranda</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_50_50" id="Footnote_50_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> He had agreed to forfeit these sums to the persons
mentioned, should he ever marry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> I had frequently, both in earnest and in jest, expressed
these hopes to him; and, in one of my letters, after touching upon some
matters relative to my own little domestic circle, I added, "This will
all be unintelligible to you; though I sometimes cannot help thinking it
within the range of possibility, that even <i>you</i>, volcano as you are,
may, one day, cool down into something of the same <i>habitable</i> state.
Indeed, when one thinks of lava having been converted into buttons for
Isaac Hawkins Browne, there is no saying what such fiery things may be
brought to at last."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_52_52" id="Footnote_52_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> Of the lamentable contrast between sentiments and conduct,
which this transfer of the seat of sensibility from the heart to the
fancy produces, the annals of literary men afford unluckily too many
examples. Alfieri, though he could write a sonnet full of tenderness to
his mother, never saw her (says Mr. W. Rose) but once after their early
separation, though he frequently passed within a few miles of her
residence. The poet Young, with all his parade of domestic sorrows, was,
it appears, a neglectful husband and harsh father; and Sterne (to use
the words employed by Lord Byron) preferred "whining over a dead ass to
relieving a living mother."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> It is the opinion of Diderot, in his Treatise on Acting,
that not only in the art of which he treats, but in all those which are
called imitative, the possession of real sensibility is a bar to
eminence;&mdash;sensibility being, according to his view, "le caractere de la
bont&eacute; de l'ame et de la m&eacute;diocrit&eacute; du g&eacute;nie."</p></div>

passage in one of his letters already given:&mdash;"My sister is in town,

naturally more attached to each other."</p></div>

are "impediments to great enterprises;" and adds, "Certainly, the best
works, and of greatest merit for the public, have proceeded from the
unmarried or childless men." See, with reference to this subject,
chapter xviii. of Mr. D'Israeli's work on "The Literary Character."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_58_58" id="Footnote_58_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> Milton's first wife, it is well known, ran away from him,
within a month after their marriage, disgusted, says Phillips, "with his
spare diet and hard study;" and it is difficult to conceive a more
melancholy picture of domestic life than is disclosed in his nuncupative
will, one of the witnesses to which deposes to having heard the great
poet himself complain, that his children "were careless of him, being
blind, and made nothing of deserting him."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59_59" id="Footnote_59_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> By whatever austerity of temper or habits the poets Dante
and Milton may have drawn upon themselves such a fate, it might be
expected that, at least, the "gentle Shakspeare" would have stood exempt
from the common calamity of his brethren. But, among the very few facts
of his life that have been transmitted to us, there is none more clearly
proved than the unhappiness of his marriage. The dates of the birth of
his children, compared with that of his removal from Stratford,&mdash;the
total omission of his wife's name in the first draft of his will, and
the bitter sarcasm of the bequest by which he remembers her
afterwards,&mdash;all prove beyond a doubt both his separation from the lady
early in life, and his unfriendly feeling towards her at the close of
it.
</p><p>
In endeavouring to argue against the conclusion naturally to be deduced
from this will, Boswell, with a strange ignorance of human nature,
remarks:&mdash;"If he had taken offence at any part of his wife's conduct, I
cannot believe that he would have taken this petty mode of expressing
it."</p></div>

"Roderick;" and with reference to an incident in it, had put the
following question to Lord Byron:&mdash;"I should like to know from you, who
are one of the philocynic sect, whether it is probable, that any dog
(out of a melodrame) could recognise a master, whom neither his own
mother or mistress was able to find out. I don't care about Ulysses's

incident, not worth mentioning, which had amused us both when I was in
town. He was rather fond (and had been always so, as may be seen in his

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_75_75" id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> He here alludes to a circumstance which I had communicated
to him in a preceding letter. In writing to one of the numerous partners
of a well-known publishing establishment (with which I have since been
lucky enough to form a more intimate connection), I had said
confidentially (as I thought), in reference to a poem that had just
appeared,&mdash;"Between you and me, I do not much admire Mr. * *'s poem."
The letter being chiefly upon business, was answered through the regular
business channel, and, to my dismay, concluded with the following
words:&mdash;"<i>We</i> are very sorry that you do not approve of Mr. * *'s new
poem, and are your obedient, &amp;c. &amp;c. L.H.R.O., &amp;c. &amp;c."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_77_77" id="Footnote_77_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> I had accused him of having entirely forgot that, in a
preceding letter, I had informed him of my intention to publish with the
Messrs. Longman in the ensuing winter, and added that, in giving him
this information, I found I had been&mdash;to use an elegant Irish

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_78_78" id="Footnote_78_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> A few passages at the beginning of these recollections
have been omitted, as containing particulars relative to Lord Byron's
mother, which have already been mentioned in the early part of this
work. Among these, however, there is one anecdote, the repetition of
which will be easily pardoned, on account of the infinitely greater
interest as well as authenticity imparted to its details by coming from
such an eye-witness as Sir Walter Scott:&mdash;"I remember," he says, "having
seen Lord Byron's mother before she was married, and a certain
coincidence rendered the circumstance rather remarkable. It was during
Mrs. Siddons's first or second visit to Edinburgh, when the music of
that wonderful actress's voice, looks, manner, and person, produced the
strongest effect which could possibly be exerted by a human being upon
her fellow-creatures. Nothing of the kind that I ever witnessed
approached it by a hundred degrees. The high state of excitation was
aided by the difficulties of obtaining entrance and the exhausting
length of time that the audience were contented to wait until the piece
commenced. When the curtain fell, a large proportion of the ladies were
generally in hysterics.
</p><p>
"I remember Miss Gordon of Ghight, in particular, harrowing the house by
the desperate and wild way in which she shrieked out Mrs. Siddons's
exclamation, in the character of Isabella, 'Oh my Byron! Oh my Byron!' A
well-known medical gentleman, the benevolent Dr. Alexander Wood,
tendered his assistance; but the thick-pressed audience could not for a
long time make way for the doctor to approach his patient, or the
patient the physician. The remarkable circumstance was, that the lady
had not then seen Captain Byron, who, like Sir Toby, made her conclude
with 'Oh!' as she had begun with it."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_79_79" id="Footnote_79_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> Mr. Murray had, at the time of giving the vase, suggested
to Lord Byron, that it would increase the value of the gift to add some
such inscription; but the feeling of the noble poet on this subject will
be understood from the following answer which he returned:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"April 9. 1815.
</p><p>
"Thanks for the books. I have great objection to your proposition
about inscribing the vase,&mdash;which is, that it would appear
<i>ostentatious</i> on my part; and of course I must send it as it is,
without any alteration.
</p><p>
"Yours," &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_80_80" id="Footnote_80_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80_80"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> Mr. Murray had presented Lady Byron with twelve drawings,

Committee, that I should be one of his colleagues. To some mistake in
the mode of conveying this proposal to me, he alludes in the preceding
sentence.</p></div>

</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"Darlington, June 3. 1815.
</p><p>
"My Lord,
</p><p>
"I have lately purchased a set of your works, and am quite vexed
that you have not cancelled the Ode to Buonaparte. It certainly was
prematurely written, without thought or reflection. Providence has
now brought him to reign over millions again, while the same
Providence keeps as it were in a garrison another potentate, who,
in the language of Mr. Burke, 'he hurled from his throne.' See if
you cannot make amends for your folly, and consider that, in almost
every respect, human nature is the same, in every clime and in
every period, and don't act the part of a <i>foolish boy</i>.&mdash;Let not
Englishmen talk of the stretch of tyrants, while the torrents of
blood shed in the East Indies cry aloud to Heaven for retaliation.
Learn, good sir, not to cast the first stone. I remain your
Lordship's servant,

</div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_84_84" id="Footnote_84_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84_84"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> Notwithstanding this precaution of the poet, the
coincidence in question was, but a few years after, triumphantly cited
in support of the sweeping charge of plagiarism brought against him by
some scribblers. The following are Mr. Sotheby's lines:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"And I have leapt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In transport from my flinty couch, to welcome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thunder as it burst upon my roof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beckon'd to the lightning, as it flash'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sparkled on these fetters."<br /></span>
</div></div>

these lines had been written long before the appearance of Lord Byron's
poem.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_85_85" id="Footnote_85_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> Mr. Taylor having inserted in the Sun newspaper (of which
he was then chief proprietor) a sonnet to Lord Byron, in return for a
present which his Lordship had sent him of a handsomely bound copy of
all his works, there appeared in the same journal, on the following day
(from the pen of some person who had acquired a control over the paper),
a parody upon this sonnet, containing some disrespectful allusion to
Lady Byron; and it is to this circumstance, which Mr. Taylor had written
to explain, that the above letter, so creditable to the feelings of the
noble husband, refers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_86_86" id="Footnote_86_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> It is but justice both to "him that gave and him that

pounds.</p></div>

the following account of this incident:&mdash;
</p><p>
"During Lord Byron's administration, a ballet was invented by the elder
Byrne, in which Miss Smith (since Mrs. Oscar Byrne) had a <i>pas seul</i>.
This the lady wished to remove to a later period in the ballet. The
ballet-master refused, and the lady swore she would not dance it at all.
The music incidental to the dance began to play, and the lady walked off
the stage. Both parties flounced into the green-room to lay the case
before Lord Byron, who happened to be the only person in that apartment.
The noble committee-man made an award in favour of Miss Smith, and both
complainants rushed angrily out of the room at the instant of my
entering it. 'If you had come a minute sooner,' said Lord Byron, 'you
would have heard a curious matter decided on by me: a question of
dancing!&mdash;by me,' added he, looking down at the lame limb, 'whom Nature
from my birth has prohibited from taking a single step.' His countenance
fell after he had uttered this, as if he had said too much; and for a
moment there was an embarrassing silence on both sides."</p></div>

follows:&mdash;"With respect to Hunt's poem, though it is, I own, full of
beauties, and though I like himself sincerely, I really could not
undertake to praise it <i>seriously</i>. There is so much of the <i>quizzible</i>

related in the Journal just referred to:&mdash;
</p><p>
"When the bailiff (for I have seen most kinds of life) came upon me in
1815 to seize my chattels, (being a peer of parliament, my person was
beyond him,) being curious (as is my habit), I first asked him "what
extents elsewhere he had for government?" upon which he showed me one
upon <i>one house only</i> for <i>seventy thousand pounds</i>! Next I asked him if
he had nothing for Sheridan? "Oh&mdash;Sheridan!" said he; "ay, I have this"
(pulling out a pocket-book, &amp;c.); "but, my Lord, I have been in
Sheridan's house a twelvemonth at a time&mdash;a civil gentleman&mdash;knows how
to deal with <i>us</i>," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Our own business was then discussed,
which was none of the easiest for me at that time. But the man was
civil, and (what I valued more) communicative. I had met many of his
brethren, years before, in affairs of my friends, (commoners, that is,)
but this was the first (or second) on my own account.&mdash;A civil man;
fee'd accordingly; probably he anticipated as much."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_96_96" id="Footnote_96_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_96_96"><span class="label">[96]</span></a> For this story, however, there was so far a foundation
that the practice to which he had accustomed himself from boyhood, of
having loaded pistols always near him at night, was considered so
strange a propensity as to be included in that list of symptoms
(sixteen, I believe, in number,) which were submitted to medical
opinion, in proof of his insanity. Another symptom was the emotion,
almost to hysterics, which he had exhibited on seeing Kean act Sir Giles
Overreach. But the most plausible of all the grounds, as he himself used
to allow, on which these articles of impeachment against his sanity were
drawn up, was an act of violence committed by him on a favourite old
watch that had been his companion from boyhood, and had gone with him to
Greece. In a fit of vexation and rage, brought on by some of those
humiliating embarrassments to which he was now almost daily a prey, he
furiously dashed this watch upon the hearth, and ground it to pieces
among the ashes with the poker.</p></div>

In a rhyming pamphlet, too, entitled "A Poetical Epistle from Delia,
addressed to Lord Byron," the writer thus charitably expresses
herself:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hopeless of peace below, and, shuddering thought!<br /></span>

From a note to Mr. Murray, it would appear that he had been first
announced as going to the Morea.
</p><p>
"I hope that the catalogue of the books, &amp;c., has not been published
without my seeing it. I must reserve several, and many ought not to be
printed. The advertisement is a very bad one. I am not going to the
Morea; and if I was, you might as well advertise a man in Russia <i>as
going to Yorkshire</i>.&mdash;Ever," &amp;c.
</p><p>
Together with the books was sold an article of furniture, which is now
in the possession of Mr. Murray, namely, "a large screen covered with
portraits of actors, pugilists, representations of boxing-matches,"
&amp;c.</p></div>

"Recollect," he says, in a letter to his brother, "the time, when we
wore white habits, on which the least spot, or a plait ill placed, would
have been a subject of grief; when our shoes were so tight we suffered
martyrdom," &amp;c.</p></div>

of Curran. "The riches," said he, "of his Irish imagination were
exhaustless. I have heard that man speak more poetry than I have ever
seen written,&mdash;though I saw him seldom and but occasionally. I saw him
presented to Madame de Sta&euml;l at Mackintosh's;&mdash;it was the grand
confluence between the Rhone and the Saone, and they were both so d&mdash;&mdash;d
ugly, that I could not help wondering how the best intellects of France
and Ireland could have taken up respectively such residences."
</p><p>
In another part, however, he was somewhat more fair to Madame de Sta&euml;l's
personal appearance:&mdash;"Her figure was not bad; her legs tolerable; her
arms good. Altogether, I can conceive her having been a desirable woman,
allowing a little imagination for her soul, and so forth. She would have
made a great man."</p></div>

almost incredible. A thin slice of bread, with tea, at breakfast&mdash;a
light, vegetable dinner, with a bottle or two of Seltzer water, tinged
with vin de Grave, and in the evening, a cup of green tea, without milk

vamped up his strange novel of the Vampire, which, under the supposition
of its being Lord Byron's, was received with such enthusiasm in France.
It would, indeed, not a little deduct from our value of foreign fame, if
what some French writers have asserted be true, that the appearance of
this extravagant novel among our neighbours first attracted their
attention to the genius of Byron.</p></div>

increased in violence until it blew tremendously; and, as it came from
the remotest extremity of the Lake, produced waves of a frightful
height, and covered the whole surface with a chaos of foam. One of our
boatmen, who was a dreadfully stupid fellow, persisted in holding the
sail at a time when the boat was on the point of being driven under
water by the hurricane. On discovering this error, he let it entirely
go, and the boat for a moment refused to obey the helm; in addition, the
rudder was so broken as to render the management of it very difficult;
one wave fell in, and then another."</p></div>

Shelley), a mixture of sensations, among which terror entered, though

alone; but I knew that my companion would have attempted to save me, and
I was overcome with humiliation, when I thought that his life might have
been risked to preserve mine. When we arrived at St. Gingoux, the
inhabitants, who stood on the shore, unaccustomed to see a vessel as
frail as ours, and fearing to venture at all on such a sea, exchanged
looks of wonder and congratulation with our boatmen, who, as well as
ourselves, were well pleased to set foot on shore."</p></div>

he spoke in high terms of the daughter of his hostess, the present
Duchess de Broglie, and, in noticing how much she appeared to be
attached to her husband, remarked that "Nothing was more pleasing than
to see the developement of the domestic affections in a very young
woman." Of Madame de Sta&euml;l, in that Memoir, he spoke thus:&mdash;"Madame de
Sta&euml;l was a good woman at heart and the cleverest at bottom, but spoilt
by a wish to be&mdash;she knew not what. In her own house she was amiable; in
any other person's, you wished her gone, and in her own again."</p></div>

was far from being pleased, and in his Memoranda, I recollect, he
described his stay there to be "like a ship under quarantine." Among
other persons whom he met in the society of that place was M. Beyle, the
ingenious author of "L'Histoire de la Peinture en Italie," who thus
describes the impression their first interview left upon him:&mdash;
</p><p>
"Ce fut pendant l'automne de 1816, que je le rencontrai au th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la
<i>Scala</i>, &agrave; Milan, dans la loge de M. Louis de Br&ecirc;me. Je fus frapp&eacute; des
yeux de Lord Byron au moment o&ugrave; il &eacute;coutait un sestetto d'un op&eacute;ra de
Mayer intitul&eacute; Elena. Je n'ai vu de ma vie, rien de plus beau ni de plus
expressif. Encore aujourd'hui, si je viens &agrave; penser &agrave; l'expression qu'un
grand peintre devrait donner an g&eacute;nie, cette t&ecirc;te sublime repara&icirc;t
tout-&agrave;-coup devant moi. J'eus un instant d'enthousiasme, et oubliant la
juste r&eacute;pugnance que tout homme un peu fier doit avoir &agrave; se faire
pr&eacute;senter &agrave; un pair d'Angleterre, je priai M. de Br&ecirc;me de m'introduire &agrave;
Lord Byron, je me trouvai le lendemain &agrave; d&icirc;ner chez M. de Br&ecirc;me, avec
lui, et le cel&egrave;bre Monti, l'immortel auteur de la <i>Basvigliana</i>. On
parla po&eacute;sie, on en vint &agrave; demander quels &eacute;taient les douze plus beaux
vers faits depuis un si&egrave;cle, en Fran&ccedil;ais, en Italien, en Anglais. Les
Italiens pr&eacute;sens s'accord&egrave;rent &agrave; designer les douze premiers vers de la
<i>Mascheroniana</i> de Monti, comme ce que l'on avait fait de plus beau dans
leur langue, depuis cent ans. <i>Monti</i> voulut bien nous les r&eacute;citer. Je
regardai Lord Byron, il fut ravi. La nuance de hauteur, ou plut&ocirc;t l'air
d'un homme <i>qui se trouve avoir &agrave; repousser une importunit&eacute;</i>, qui
d&eacute;parait un peu sa belle figure, disparut tout-&agrave;-coup pour faire &agrave;
l'expression du bonheur. Le premier chant de la <i>Mascheroniana</i>, que
Monti r&eacute;cita presque en entier, vaincu par les acclamations des
auditeurs, causa la plus vive sensation &agrave; l'auteur de Childe Harold. Je
n'oublierai jamais l'expression divine de ses traits; c'&eacute;tait l'air
serein de la puissance et du g&eacute;nie, et suivant moi, Lord Byron n'avait,
en ce moment, aucune affectation &agrave; se reprocher."</p></div>

to be epic!&mdash;Even Mr. D'Israeli has, for the sake of a theory, given in

authenticity arises from the circumstance of St. Paul having (according
to the opinion of Mosheim and others) written an epistle to the
Corinthians, before that which we now call his first. They are, however,
universally given up as spurious. Though frequently referred to as
existing in the Armenian, by Primate Usher, Johan. Gregorius, and other
learned men, they were for the first time, I believe, translated from
that language by the two Whistons, who subjoined the correspondence,
with a Greek and Latin version, to their edition of the Armenian History
of Moses of Chorene, published in 1736.
</p><p>
The translation by Lord Byron is, as far as I can learn, the first that
has ever been attempted in English; and as, proceeding from <i>his</i> pen,
it must possess, of course, additional interest, the reader will not be
displeased to find it in the Appendix. Annexed to the copy in my
possession are the following words in his own handwriting:&mdash;"Done into
English by me, January, February, 1817, at the Convent of San Lazaro,
with the aid and exposition of the Armenian text by the Father Paschal
Aucher, Armenian friar.&mdash;BYRON. I had also (he adds) the Latin text, but
it is in many places very corrupt, and with great omissions."</p></div>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
